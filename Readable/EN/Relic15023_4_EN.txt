Even in the era when blackened blood flowed freely, they were not stained by even the smallest smidge of mud.

The silent mountain people and the steel moon constructed their peaceful camp.

"Oh daughter of the cliffs of Glazed Sand Crystal, weep not for me."
"I was born in the shade of Tianheng, and I fight to repay Rex Lapis' mercy."
"I entrust my life to the four-armed Yaksha, and we shall go into the glowing depths."
"The shadowed road of the darkest pits we shall tread, we shall brave the stony crystal halls."
"We will face the defilement arising from the depths, the twisted beasts that dwell there."
"These horrors and their strangeness shall not put me to flight or fear."

He simply left this small flower for that young daughter of the mountain tribe as a memento, a ward against forgetting.

"The only thing I truly fear is to be lost and forgotten."
"Should ill fate dictate that I am to be buried in some nameless place, do not forget me."
