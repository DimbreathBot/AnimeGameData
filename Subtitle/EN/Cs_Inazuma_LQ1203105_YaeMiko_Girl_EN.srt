1
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,300
Wow

2
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:11,300
So many

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,900
They're everywhere...

4
00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:14,475
Yes

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,300
The memories of the youkai

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,100
They haven't been able to relax and soar through the air like this

7
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:20,900
For a long time

8
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,550
Come with me

9
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,650
You alright, little one?

10
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:38,000
You look a little nervous

11
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:38,925
It's just...

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,975
Paimon's never seen anything like this before...

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,150
Whoa

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,500
They've really blocked out the moon!

15
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:52,300
It does look a little intimidating

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,750
Doesn't it

17
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:55,600
But I know them

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,575
They may be loud and brash at times

19
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,900
But they are good and brave souls

20
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,950
Even after losing their lives in a brutal war

21
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,300
They have never given into grief or despair

22
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:11,125
Alas, their time is short

23
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:44,600
Do they...

24
00:01:44,775 --> 00:01:47,150
Do they really have to go?

25
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,200
It's a feast

26
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,625
And all feasts come to an end

27
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,150
Hehe

28
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,275
Since you're sorry to see them leave

29
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,100
Why don't you do the recital along with me?

30
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,250
"Oh, Hakushin, cause of this enchantment"

31
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,825
"In reverence I perform this rite"

32
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:08,106
"In reverence I perform this rite"

33
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,925
"To be a guiding light..."

34
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:22,700
Wow

35
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,200
So beautiful

36
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,150
Look

37
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,050
Lights are coming from Inazuma City!

38
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,525
The book says

39
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,300
Recite the secret spells of Lady Kitsune tonight

40
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,100
And our wishes will come true...

41
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:51,450
"Oh, Hakushin, cause of this enchantment"

42
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,225
"I perform this rite, to be a guiding light"

43
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:56,000
"Your unrivaled power..."

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,400
"...will be honored eternally"

45
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,750
Urakusai

46
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,350
You asked if I was doing well

47
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:17,050
Really, every day is a happy day for me

48
00:03:17,425 --> 00:03:18,775
But watching

49
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,795
You all leave now

50
00:03:21,475 --> 00:03:23,900
I can't help but feel a little lonely

51
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:25,225
Mmm...

52
00:03:25,675 --> 00:03:27,825
Just a little, of course
