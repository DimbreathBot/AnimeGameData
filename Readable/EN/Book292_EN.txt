"That's not it."
These words burst out suddenly.
In the nameless mountain shrine, the black-haired princess sat still, her face flickering between light and shadow in the face of a flame.
"What do you mean 'that's not it'?"
Came the reply, almost as a conditioned reflex.
"What I mean, you dumb samurai, is: don't you have any thoughts concerning me, the princess who brings destruction?"
"Thoughts? Well, I think you're quite the character, for one."
"I don't mean 'thoughts' in that sense." Princess Mina sounded quite exasperated now. "I mean with regards to saving me."
"Strictly speaking, I didn't save you."
The samurai corrected.
"At that time, you ordered me to take you away in your capacity as princess. In that sense, you saved yourself."
"Oh, is that how you see it?"
An expected reply.
Well, the samurai thought, it had been worth a shot trying to dodge responsibility.

"In any case, this 'princess who brings destruction' nonsense... Hah. Isn't that just an excuse for making war?"
The samurai's lackadaisical tone shifted.
"Also,"
The samurai turned around, void-like eyes now aflame.
"'Destroying the world' is an utterly stupid concept. You'll understand soon enough."
