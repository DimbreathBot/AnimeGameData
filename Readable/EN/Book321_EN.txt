If you find this bottle, I may no longer be in this world.
I originally thought that these pirates, having their ways and means, might be able to send me back to Liyue, which was why I got onboard their ship. I never expected that...
Ah, forget it. I suppose this is what they call destiny...
Before I came to Inazuma, I worried that my old mother's place would be burgled, as she lives alone, so I left a check for all the Mora I've saved over these past few years buried in the location marked out on this map. Please help me retrieve that check and exchange it at the Northland Bank. The Mora will then be yours to do with as you please, save for a small portion that I would like used to pay my mother's living expenses. Her name is Minamoto Kotomi, and she lives in the Guili Plains. Please do this for me, and thank you!

I'm sorry, Mother. I found loads of those Sakura Blooms that could be found all over your homeland, but it's a shame that I cannot send them to your side.
