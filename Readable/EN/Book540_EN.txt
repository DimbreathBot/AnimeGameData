(Azariq left this document in the control cabin. It seems to be a transcribed copy. The document has been cobbled together from writings done by many hands, so it is likely not the original...)
...According to past documents, this machine can participate in combat even if some parts are damaged. There are also auxiliary control cabins apart from the main control area that allow for more precise operations...
...Additionally, the energy relay system that lines and joins the various junctions and passages is a rather intricate design that builds upon this foundation. If necessary, damaged sections of the energy supply can be disconnected or discarded so that large-scale malfunctions may be avoided. With the main body functionally intact, all pre-existing directives can still be carried out...
...According to previous records of investigations into the giant Ruin Machine on Devantaka Mountain, the layout of the energy circuits can be seen as such...
(Below is a diagram that depicts a restoration of the giant machine's energy pathways. The notes at the side are very complicated, full of notes such as these...)
...The control linkage between the main control cabin and the three or four auxiliary control cabins...
...Foundational energy pathway experiment results...
...There are studies on the arrangement of these lumps, which are used as energy sources at pathway junctions...
...Aha, I've got it. It's quite elementary, really! I believe I've come to a rather perfect guess about the energy pathways and structures of this giant machine, but unfortunately, there isn't enough blank space on this diagram, so it can't go here.
