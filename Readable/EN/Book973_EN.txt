Starting today, I'm swapping to a new notebook!

After all, (...)'s revelation indicates that we'll catch up with Uncle Taika and the others, and embark on an adventure to Cinder City together. As such, it's important to establish a sense of ritual!

A magnificent fortress built by an ancient tyrant... Exciting, no? Hehe. No matter the danger, you can remain at ease, and safely leave it in the hands of the apprentice of the apprentice of the apprentice of Grand Master Sanhaj â€” and by that I mean the super awesome Spiritcaller prodigy, Liriwu!

I don't know what else I can do. Even the voices of the Wayob cannot be heard here, and no mystical art I've learned can be used. Even healing arts have no effect...

If a more experienced mystic... No, I fear that even Grand Master Sanhaj could not dispel the curse laid upon this place.

Ancestors above, what in the world happened here?
