Delicately made, it showcases the elegance and customs of the old nobles.

The first nobles who rose up to rule Mondstadt began as heroes of humble origins.
These great chieftains and elegant princes as well as beautiful princesses and noblemen
once welcomed the people to their banquets and feasts.
In those days long past, the nobles shared their wisdom and elegance generously.

In that golden age, the nobles shared with the people their knowledge and profits.
But the later nobles were seduced by power. Their banquets were exclusively for their own pleasure.
