A feather left behind by the giant wings that flattened the mountains.
Though its tip has long turned a deep black, this feather remains sharp as a naked blade.

They say that in ancient times, when the world was in turmoil, Rex Lapis uprooted mountains to create a giant bird of prey.
The bird was carved out of rock and jade, and it soared above the ground the moment it had taken shape.
Spiraling toward the heavens, it pierced through the clouds and flattened many stone peaks therein.

They say that the rock kite spread its wings and dived towards the ocean,
Plummeting from the sky like a sharpened spear,
Right into the heart of the sea, and the monsters within...

And they say that the pillars of stone that jut out from the ocean continue to attract birds to this day.
