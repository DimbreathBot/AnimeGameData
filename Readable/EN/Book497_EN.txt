If Tarafa were writing this, I suppose he might say this...
You who come after us:
We are the descendants of Al-Ahmar. We are those who are fated to follow in the footsteps of the king of the crimson sands.
But the prosperous past is too far gone, and there are many now whose faith wavers, just like Tarafa.
He betrayed us, and took us for fools all the while.
Umur, Bahaddin, and Rabeed... All dead, due to his meddling.
My own death I faked a few days prior to avoid his scrutiny, and I then struck first before he could attack Samail.
This stone slate... It was the matriarch of Tanit's ploy all along.
It is likely, then, that there is no treasure to be found within Gurabad's corpse after all.
We were deceived.
Perhaps our journey really was accursed, just as Tarafa claimed.
And our curse was Tarafa... and the mother he trusted in.
Samail says that this keystone might be real, but I doubt it. Whatever the case may be, it is now worthless to us.
So let it lie here... and you who come after, hear me now: May you escape being deceived by those you trust.
