This place known as The Chasm has shone with a cinnabar luster since ancient days.
The mountain miners and the metropolitan merchants still tell the legend of a Yaksha...
People say that the lone traveler with four arms once came to the barren wastes where the star fell.
Hearing that this wandering figure's evil-exorcising travels had now brought them hence, the tribes-people of the mountains came forward one after another:

"Guest from afar, please accept our wine, and hear our plea."
"You may consider our aged spirits bitter and hard to swallow, a far cry from the sweet brews of Mt. Tianheng that even Rex Lapis praises."
"But the heavens have graced us with stores of precious stones and marvelous jade, and we carve the jagged rock for a living."
"Thanks to the grace of Rex Lapis, our lives are, while not ideal, at least free of terror."
"Yet things have changed, and a dark shadow is cast over the blessing we have received from the fallen star."
"We do not have any precious gifts to present as a pledge, but still we beg for your succor."

The guest heard the elders' plea, and silently drank every drop of that bitter wine.
The guest promised nothing, and did not chastise the mortals for their insolence, but simply turned east, disregarding all attempts to make them stay.

As for what came after, all now know what happened...

But the simple crystal-sand wine cup that the guest shared with the tribal elders remains to this day as a testament to their pact.
