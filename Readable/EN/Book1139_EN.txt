Jahoda, I knew you would come back.
By the time you read this letter, I'll already have departed for where I belong. Don't worry, I made peace with it long ago. At the very least, this time, it's my decision.
That pendant... necklace... I'm sorry, I can't remember. My mind's becoming more and more muddled, and I can barely hold this quill...
As for the stuff I left with the Adventurers' Guild, it's yours — whether you want to return it to its rightful owner, or keep it for yourself, is up to you.
Jahoda, even though I'm not your friend — and you're not mine — I'm glad that you came here to speak with me. I wish you the best, and that you're always the one calling the shots, no matter what.
That's all I have to write. People like us don't have stories worth leaving behind.
Run on ahead, Jahoda. And run fast.
Take nothing with you, except yourself.
