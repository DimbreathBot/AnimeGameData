(Hastily scrawled notes transcribed from an unknown source.)
...The true source of the mysterious power unique to this place that the locals call Khvarena is unknown. But based on its ability to eliminate or reverse the influence of the Abyss (in fact, it is a type of annihilation reaction), the two powers are of the same level, that is to say, they are of same order in terms of rules... 
...In other words, both possess the power to "re-write the rules"...
...Regrettably, be it the Abyss or Khvarena, all current users are stuck in an "unconscious" stage of being influenced and overwritten by their power...
