The sea breeze at dawn, rapturous and free, sings this ancient hymn—
Time flowed forward no longer, but returned to the past with the singer.

Along the waters it flowed, passing the gilded domes of the glorious kingdom,
On the soft summer wind it passed through the green manor ringed by towering walls.
Whether aristocrats in their light ships, or barbarians brought as captives,
All were intoxicated by the music of a beautiful age, immersed in the memories...

For this was the golden world of abundance — an era of a righteous, glorious king.

"I came from a puny realm on a lone isle. I was born in a hut, and I grew up in a village built of reeds and grass."
"When the warriors in their bright mail came to my home, they announced the news of 'conquest.'"
"I was but a mere youth, and I naively followed these towering demigods to the capital."
"It was by dint of my agile fingers and bright voice that I evaded the fate of bondage."
"Only after the God King recognized me did I first witness the might of civilization and order."
"Let my flesh and bone, then, be utterly changed. Let my name and tribe be forsaken. The world shall know only the name 'Boethius'!"

And thus was the child born of barbarism moved by the golden palace, and became a servant of a majestic authority.
Like one newborn, he worked to abandon the ancient savage customs and devoured new knowledge...
All he did, he did to transform himself into a person of true honor and glory, into a part of this great civilization.
For nothing else did he toil, for this was the golden world of abundance — an era of a righteous, glorious king enthroned.
