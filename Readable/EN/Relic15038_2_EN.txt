In the age when wildfire consumed the roots of the world, and when the barbarian tribes sliced through the briars to open the mountains and woods,
Many stories transpired that were never recorded or eulogized in any human history.

The wisest among dragons traversed the burning plains, carrying the seed split from the primal fire, stepping into a rugged, untamed land.
Yet as it walked through hot springs and valleys that dragonkind had yet to touch, seeing things grown from soil or created, none met its expectations.
Until one day, when the fog dispersed in a deep valley, it discovered the creator's most beloved, and yet the weakest of species,
Those who should still have been wrapped in swaddling cloths yet were born in a land where dragons did dance, and so could only eke out survival in the shadow of ancient wings.
Though they had long lost their guidance, forgotten their past histories and memories, and lost themselves amidst mountain and wood, they endured still.

Marveling at their tenacity, unity, and courage, the sage amongst dragons resolved to grant them the kindling of wisdom,
But that precious gift was not without cost. It would civilize these barbarians, but it would also order their destinies.
For unlike the plan of that first divine one, what the most sage one brought was the profane path of "evolution,"
Its far sight had divined that at the end of that path, human blood would be poured into the derelict body of the moribund earth,

Merging two species and two bloodlines as one, and thus would an ancient pulse surge through a reborn civilization.
Indeed, it would be as the wisest one said unto the first barbarian who climbed upon the floating landmass to visit it:

"But from your heirs shall come the savior of two worlds. He shall be brutal as the lions and scorpions, but as cunning as a wild fox."
"One day, he shall slay the overlord of fire and ascend to the oldest of thrones. Praise be unto the ruler of two worlds!"
