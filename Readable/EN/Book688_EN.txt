Common problems and appropriate emergency response measures are listed in this manual. If an error not included in the manual occurs, please contact Senior Researcher Bravais at once.

Common errors include the following:
Insufficient Energy Supply:
This error is usually caused by insufficient pipe pressure, specifically when an indicator gas leak occurs from the valve or exterior surface of the pipe. To address this, adjust the valve by turning the handwheel until the valve is no longer leaking indicator gasses.
System Overheated:
This error indicates the press temperature is too high. In this state, the entire system is more hazardous. Addressing this is a high priority. The recommended method is to decrease the temperature of the press's ventilation window and initiate the cooling program to dissipate the heat.
Water Entering the System:
When this error occurs, abort the process and perform an inspection of the environmental sealing to prevent reoccurrence. In case of emergency, the emergency drainage function can also be activated to temporarily address the unexpected presence of excess water.
Blocked Emergency Drainage Pipe:
This error is normally caused by a foreign substance blocking the drainage pipe. When this error occurs, simply inspect and clear the drainage pipe.

Repair Requests & Feedback Log:
...
Repair Request: Evidence of leakage on the ground found near the cooling system water intake under the press. Requesting urgent maintenance.
Maintenance Outcome: Temporary sealant has been applied to the water intake to prevent water ingress. Due to the risk of backflow when using the cooling system, its use has been suspended until a permanent solution can be implemented.
