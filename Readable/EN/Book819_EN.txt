Oh dear, my apologies!

I've received word from the Commission. There's a new case that requires my immediate attention.
As for that canine case you were concerned about, I've already got the evidence.

But Yoriki Owada kept warning me not to reveal anything to unrelated persons, so... sorry, but my lips are sealed!
Oh, but there's a but! It's really unfortunate, but I accidentally misplaced something again. You know, the details concerning new admissions to that "Puppy Union."

I believe it's nearby, so could you help me look for it?
If you find it, please double-check it to see if it's indeed the evidence, and then find a time to return it to me! Thank you so much!
