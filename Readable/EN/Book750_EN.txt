Dear Colleagues and Researchers, the Fontaine Research Institute is a place for research and a temple of science, and it is natural to consume paper and stationery. However, paper consumption at the Institute has been unusually high for the past three months straight. Thus, this is a stern reminder that paper is for research purposes and for theorizing on, not for wrapping snacks, propping up desks, or horseplay. If you have a need for the latter, the Logistics Office will be happy to provide the appropriate items.
P.S.: Gambling is strictly prohibited in the Institute. Anyone using paper as gambling chips will be handed over to the Disciplinary Office for investigation.
