A small flower-shaped insignia. There seems to be music coming from it.

Among the members of the troupe was a charismatic swordswoman.
Beautiful as the light on water, elegant as the chirping lark.
Her every slash hummed a tune of the wind.

This was in keeping with the troupe's performances, which were intended for two very different audiences.
For the audience of foes, the music drifted far beyond the stage.
