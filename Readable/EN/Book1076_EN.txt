...

After the review, I paid a visit to Je'lal, and asked for her aid in forging a bow as a farewell gift for my daughter.

After telling her why I had sought her out, she remained silent for about two minutes. Her turquoise eyes blazed as she replied:

"You would do well to remember, Eighth Lord, that you are exploiting a kindness I never owed you in the first place. How dare you ask me to debase myself and forge crude weapons for those insignificant humans? Had anyone but the Sovereign or you uttered such insolence, I would have already ripped the blasphemous tongue from their mouth and stitched a new crimson gown for my jades with it. I refuse. I will not entertain this ludicrous insult. I would not deign to reconsider even if you laid a hundred thousand slaves at my feet."

Before I could say anything else, she flew away without looking back. To reject it so vehemently from the start... With her surly temperament, that essentially meant a "yes."

...

As expected, Je'lal secretly sent a Source Servant to deliver the forged bow, and sent also a message that I might not misunderstand her: This bow was "made by a common dragon craftsman in her territory," a "shoddy piece made with worthless scrap," and had "absolutely nothing to do with her."

As she claimed, she truly does not forge any "crude weapons." Those jade pieces were treasured (...) she had hoarded for ages, ones that even (...) might not scorch. A shame about the bowstrings, though, as they remained ordinary. Had I known, I would've had her forge a sword instead.

Well, no matter. My dearest daughter ought to adore this "gift from some common dragon craftsman," Ix Je'lal K'ua'l Ka'. I shall give thought to remuneration later...
