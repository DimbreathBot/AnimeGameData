1
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:41,125
That's all you've got?

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,000
What happened to searching for your answer?

3
00:01:36,823 --> 00:01:37,875
Fight's over

4
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:39,895
Do you yield?

5
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:43,799
You won

6
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:48,400
Well then, looks like you found your answer

7
00:02:06,475 --> 00:02:07,927
I give his glory to you

8
00:02:25,825 --> 00:02:27,375
I've seen that light...

9
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:39,150
That is the light of our Lord... The great Hermanubis, priest over all other priests

10
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,943
His spirit dwells within that lightning, and his will lives on

11
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,950
Once a warrior of Tighnar, he emerged from the barren desert sands

12
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,195
To serve the God King, Al-Ahmar

13
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:04,925
After the death of the God King, Hermanubis gathered his followers

14
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:07,525
And the Tighnarian priests

15
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:11,250
And led them to the city of Tulaytullah

16
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:18,903
There, they founded the Temple of Silence. And from that day forth

17
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,175
We became stewards of all knowledge

18
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:25,875
That survived from King Deshret's civilization

19
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:32,615
Barely a century passed before war ravaged the desert

20
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:38,864
One by one, Eremite leaders took up arms against each other in battles

21
00:03:38,864 --> 00:03:42,325
That would devour what little remained of their civilization

22
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,225
Only the wise city of Tulaytullah

23
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:49,178
Was spared under the guiding hand of the Tighnarians

24
00:03:50,723 --> 00:03:53,219
But peace did not last

25
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:59,811
Coveting the knowledge of King Deshret, the beasts set their eyes on Tulaytullah

26
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:04,325
The king of Gurabad laid siege to the city

27
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:12,803
And ordered the sages to surrender to him the Temple of Silence, as proof of his victory

28
00:04:14,147 --> 00:04:17,667
The ruling elite colluded with their oppressors

29
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:23,363
Betraying the Temple so as to hold onto their rule over the city

30
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,400
They declared that the knowledge guarded by the Temple was the true cause of corruption

31
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:35,011
These were dark days, and we faced enemies on all sides

32
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:40,349
Our Lord had long since exhausted his strength

33
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:45,141
Keeping the forbidden knowledge introduced by King Deshret at bay

34
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:49,105
To ensure the Temple's continued survival

35
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:52,475
He broke his being into many pieces

36
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,389
And began the ceremony of Hermanubis's legacy

37
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,175
Bestowing his power upon his mortal followers

38
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:03,275
With this power

39
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,070
The Temple was able to defeat the tyrant's army

40
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,875
Yet we were not hailed as heroes

41
00:05:11,675 --> 00:05:15,150
Strange and unfamiliar as this power was

42
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:20,544
It struck fear into the people's hearts, and drove them to reject us

43
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:27,275
In the end, the people of the Temple and the Tulaytullah Tighnarians

44
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:32,675
Left the city for good, and made their way to the rainforest

45
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:36,700
What followed next was inevitable

46
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,742
The elite of Tulaytullah fell, and were decimated

47
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:44,024
War engulfed the desert...

48
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:49,805
And we wandered from place to place, always in hiding

49
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:53,283
All the while keeping close watch over our secrets

50
00:05:53,283 --> 00:05:55,256
And staying true to our mission

51
00:05:57,075 --> 00:06:01,656
Betrayal forced us out of the desert and into the forest

52
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:08,082
Then mistrust drove us from the forest, into the desert once more

53
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,592
We have lived in exile for far, far too long...

54
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:27,156
Yet today, the Temple of Silence has borne witness to the glory of Hermanubis once more

55
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,714
...Thank you
