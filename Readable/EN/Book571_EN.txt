After our conversation the other day, I went over the prophecy's wording carefully. "A flower that is not of this world" sounds more like a logical paradox. Think about it: If a flower is not of this world, its existence cannot be perceived. However, if it can be perceived, it will not fit the description of the prophecy. As such, my view is that the riddle's answer doesn't have to be a real plant. However, I must also note, with all due respect, that the person who came up with this riddle may not know all the plants in the world (and I'd daresay that no one could make such a claim). From this perspective, you could even think of some rare plants as potential candidates for the answer.

Attached is a list of rare plant species. I've added a short description to each entry, and I hope you can find your answer within them.

Best wishes to you.
