Not only do we share the same resilient skin,
But the same divine essence flows within our veins.
As there is one wisdom, one melody,
So too are our wills one.
Comrades,
We are the hands and legs, the shield and sword,
Roots and leaves, spring and stream.
We should draw near to each other,
Even unto outlanders must this be so.
