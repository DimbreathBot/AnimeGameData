To The Steambird.
Mosso's death 30 years ago is still on my mind. Whenever I think of your paper's rhetoric, which intentionally passes off falsehoods as truth, I simply cannot suppress my indignation. As such, I have taken Sir Arthur captive.
I eagerly await your paper's sincere repentance. Issue a public apology and surrender Mosso's legacy.
Should you continue to spin a web of lies that obfuscates the truth, I will be left with no choice but to slay that Steambird.
Crow or Blackbird?
