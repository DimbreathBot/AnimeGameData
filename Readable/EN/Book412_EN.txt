This series of islands is the most unique area I have encountered on this trip. It seems ostensibly ordinary, but the various mountains here have been hollowed out such that changes in their internal water levels will cause them to resound.
At the same time, the waters that crisscross the mountains are linked. At high tide, the mountains will play a preset tune together as they resonate as one.
I have never encountered the use of mountains, let alone an entire island chain, as a musical instrument of titanic proportions. The designer of this setup must have had great ingenuity, but also a pair of immensely skilled hands.
I stayed here for a while longer to closely observe and record the geography and design of these mountains, while listening to the music that they make at various times of the day.

The great creativity of their creator in blending nature and artistry together so perfectly leaves me, frankly, in awe.
Good designs should never be lost, and so I have left these notes for any who should come by after me.
If you, too, have come to this place, rest awhile on the mountaintops and let the tides make music for you.
It is no easy undertaking to make nature itself lie beside you and sing to you. Indeed, it is an epoch-making deed.
I hope that you, too, will get to enjoy this sight.

P.S.: This sheet of paper has been alchemically treated to be water- and fire-proof. Do not worry about the veracity of these notes. Just enjoy the music and the scenery.
