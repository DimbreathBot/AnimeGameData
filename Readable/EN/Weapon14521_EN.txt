After the great tower of Shah Ramshahr finally fell, like a honeyed yet poisoned dream swallowed by the blood-soaked sands...
His royal power shifted between countless states as fleeting as the morning dew, until it was buried itself in yet more blood and tears.
Beneath the sapphire domes, those nobles who once pledged allegiance to the tyrant broke free of his yoke...
Only to follow false sages and be drawn into games of carnage and collapse amid the scorching sands once more.

O, the proud people of Tulaytullah who had long forgotten the silent warnings of the sages.
It was only when their ambitions faded along with Gurkan's name that they came to know the true cost of rebellion.
By the time the brutal Khagans arrived on horseback, there were no more warriors guarding the Garden of Endless Pillars.
And like tamed beasts, those who dwelled in gilded dreams had no choice but to lower their heads before new masters once more.

Soldiers and tax collectors, driven by insatiable greed, came from distant lands to prey upon the already weary people.
Though the viridian court, which had claimed such benevolence, was unrelentingly harsh to its people.
There will always be those who, subjugated beneath the iron-clad hooves of foreign tribes, seek solace in a romanticized past.
They whispered praise for the brief reign of King Humayun while huddled in the shade, taking shelter from the searing sun.

The young noble Goudarz stepped into the sacred hall buried deep beneath the sands, determined to free his countrymen from their shackles.
Legend has it that the palace belonged to the Ibis King, and the wisest of the seven sage monks — the keeper of records — who served as secret envoy to the moon and stars.
But that desperate and near-hopeless assault stood little chance, for no plan could match the conqueror's forces, which blazed with the brilliance of the sun.
The wise men of Tighnar had long since fled, and that magnificent sanctuary of wisdom in the desert lay buried beneath the iron-hued sea of sand.
Yet, from the depths of a dried-up spring, sacred and ancient echoes rose in answer to the young man's prayers...

"O reckless child, o noble one, you yearn for the power of the blazing sun and the fury of sandstorms, yet you dream the fool's dream of raising a tower from quicksand."
"I can bestow upon you a power not yet witnessed by prophet or proselyte, much as one might give bitter and brackish water to a thirsty camel."
"However, the lord of the flowers and oases once left three riddles for my master, King Deshret."
"But he, wise and sagacious as he was, could not answer them before he fell into that poisonous dream."
"If you can lift the fog of confusion that has long plagued me, I will grant you the power of a king."

The young Goudarz answered thusly:
"Then pray reveal these ancient riddles, o Holy One, of the sacred edicts, writing, medicine, and wisdom."
"I shall offer my mortal answers with truest sincerity, for there is no room for the shadows of falsehood on my path."

And so, the wisest of them all among the sage monks spoke thusly:
"What rises and falls in endless turns, perishing at its apex before swelling once more?"
"Like the moon, it waxes full, then wanes away into nothing."
"Both the wise and the foolish yearn for it, in ceaseless cycles of desire."
"Yet like the tides, it ebbs and flows within the hearts of men."

The young Goudarz answered thusly:
"What you speak of is conspiracy and treachery. The robes of those who speak idly of virtue conceal nothing but festering weakness and fatigue."
"It is this very weakness that brought down the sapphire domes, and it is this very weakness that has driven the people to cry out in sorrow."

The sage monk burst out in laughter, though he did not directly address the youthful noble's answer.
Nonetheless, he handed him the Staff of Falsehoods.

And this was how Goudarz's name became lost to history...
To be replaced by the mighty title of King Saleb Dowleh.
The warrior who once would brook no lies had gained kingly power through cunning.
Casting the illusion of a golden age over the fading hues of twilight.

...

It was not until even the most perfect lie could no longer control his insatiable thirst for power...
Until King Deshret's creations could no longer fabricate the illusion of divine manifestation...
Until the voice of the Ibis King rose once more to ask him that very same question...
That the aged king gave his final answer amid the laments of Gurabad:

"O Holy One, all I speak are lies. Even I do not trust my own words."
"The only thing I can do now is fight to the death. At the very least, I shall not betray once more the trust of the brothers who have come to my rescue."
"O, Holy One, whether you seek truth or falsehood, you must taste it in your own blood."

His kingly power was seized by the Deys of other tribes, and on and on it went, until the various kingdoms were ground to dust by the desert winds.
And, as if collecting moonlight like amber honey, the holy one had taken the king's last will as his final answer.
