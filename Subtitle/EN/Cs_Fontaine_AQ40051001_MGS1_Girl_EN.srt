1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,950
A magician's greatest skill

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,075
Is making things disappear

3
00:00:05,225 --> 00:00:06,275
Or appear

4
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:08,875
The possibilities are endless

5
00:00:40,325 --> 00:00:42,350
But this isn't what you came for

6
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,225
These little tricks? You've seen them all before

7
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:50,650
So it's time for something truly extraordinary

8
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,125
Don't you think?

9
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:54,650
This one's a little tricky

10
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:05,975
Using this water tank

11
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:09,175
I shall make my sister vanish completely

12
00:01:09,225 --> 00:01:11,700
Right before your very eyes

13
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:27,175
It's actually quite simple

14
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,800
She'll just turn into air bubbles

15
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,800
And float right out of the top...

16
00:01:39,275 --> 00:01:40,250
Oh no

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,225
I told them to check all the props carefully

18
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,950
With the lid on

19
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,875
Even air can't escape...

20
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,375
An amateur magician would be getting

21
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:52,075
Very nervous right around now

22
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:53,675
Hehe

23
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,000
Luckily it's me on stage!

24
00:01:56,275 --> 00:01:59,200
So let me show you what a true virtuoso can do

25
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:13,575
Lynette

26
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:14,875
Are you still there?

27
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,900
Don't go too far

28
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:19,400
We don't wanna use up all our magic

29
00:02:19,475 --> 00:02:20,425
Hi

30
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:21,800
I'm back
