1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,824
Magic should be mysterious, surprising...

2
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:08,325
And defy logic

3
00:00:08,725 --> 00:00:10,675
Magic is hard work

4
00:00:10,925 --> 00:00:14,650
Every single movement has to be practiced thousands of times

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,150
It's alright. We're used to that

6
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:25,425
We're sorry. You've taught us so much

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,975
But we can't tell you the whole truth

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,550
It's okay. Do you still remember what I told you?

9
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:36,450
This world is full of lies and falsehoods

10
00:00:37,875 --> 00:00:42,260
I only hope that one day, you can find your own truth...

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,816
What about you?

12
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,175
Have you found your truth?

13
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,425
Magic is my truth

14
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:52,600
I want to perform a magic trick so great

15
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:54,425
That people will always think of me

16
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:55,833
When they talk about it

17
00:00:56,729 --> 00:00:58,137
For a magician

18
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,400
What greater honor could there be?

19
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:03,641
Look!

20
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,275
Behold! Lyney is sealed inside the box

21
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,975
Will he manage to escape?

22
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:16,600
Ten years ago, Cesar attempted this very trick, and it was at this precise moment that...

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,300
Lyney!

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,324
Watch out!

25
00:01:36,253 --> 00:01:37,469
Mysterious

26
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:41,629
Surprising

27
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:47,100
And logic-defying...

28
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:50,375
Isn't that right?

29
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,493
This honor belongs to you

30
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:56,093
Cesar

31
00:02:01,277 --> 00:02:03,450
I'm just sorry it's a little late
