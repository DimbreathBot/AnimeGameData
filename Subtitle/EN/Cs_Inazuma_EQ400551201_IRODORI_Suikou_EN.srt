1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,050
One Year

2
00:00:01,225 --> 00:00:03,950
The poet Suikou made his way to Tenshukaku

3
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:07,100
And presented the Kasen's work for the Shogun's perusal

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:11,475
But a page from the works of Aoi no Okina had been torn out

5
00:00:11,675 --> 00:00:14,000
And Suikou was questioned regarding the matter

6
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,375
Suikou pleaded guilty

7
00:00:17,728 --> 00:00:20,992
He admitted to drinking at the tavern the night before

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,950
And vaguely recalled a mysterious figure approaching while he was intoxicated
