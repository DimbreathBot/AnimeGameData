"I see. What a cunning fellow..."
My uncle stared at me with obvious interest, as if waiting for me to continue. Seeing that, I took a deep breath and started explaining my deductions.
"As you have said, when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. So with your hypothesis in mind, everyone at the scene could be guilty — and in the worst case, everyone could be involved. Robben the Phantom Thief may, in fact, be a group rather than a person..."
I recalled everyone back there, trying to remember every trivial suspicious thing.
"Ms. Leblanc from The Steambird is definitely an admirer of Robben. Well, I did examine her journalistic credentials, but forging identification papers should be easy for him."
"Mr. Chandler from the Maison Gardiennage left the scene for a time, and did not return till the theft had already happened. He was incredibly infuriated, but on further consideration, that might also have been an act."
"Madame Christie from the Marechaussee Phantom has been stressing to everyone the possibility of Robben using a clockwork meka. Considering your hypothesis, this could in fact be a deliberate red herring."
...
"Well, who do you think? Amongst all these people, who is the most likely to be the culprit?"
Having evaluated everyone for the possibility of guilt, I asked my uncle this question with much care.
"You have keen eyes indeed." My uncle put his pipe down and stood up, his steel cane glinting coolly in the moonlight. "However, you've missed something... something most vital to the case."
I was stunned for a moment. He raised the cane.
"You — the gentleman who came to see the uncle he has never met, claiming to be Poiret — were in the crowd back then, too. Am I not right, Mr. Robben?"
