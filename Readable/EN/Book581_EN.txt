You are correct to assume that I seldom lie. This has to do with my upbringing. As a desert-dweller who has been living within the Akademiya since my childhood, my unusual identity makes it hard for others to trust me â€” and it would have been harder still if I was not honest. As a result, I learned to talk less and speak no more than what is necessary.

Uncovering the secret behind the prophecy may come with its perils. If you need someone who would never lie, I can join you.
