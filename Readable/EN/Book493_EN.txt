You who come after us:
If there was a prayer in praise of the night, then I would sing its second strain in memory of the wounded and the dead.
For Bahaddin, who shall not again see.
"It was a familiar pain, white scales falling from under one's brow. And then, all that came from that vast orbital cavity was a suffocating, shuddering silence."
I must record what I have seen here.
One of our hunters, Bahaddin, was taken in the claws of a Red Vulture before our very eyes.
When we saw him again, his other eye socket was empty as well.
Several years ago, he lost an eye hunting Red Vultures, but he brought back the fiercest quarry we had ever seen. Now, a scant few years on, the shriveled face of the man hunted by the vulture was twisted as it faced us, and his eye, once like unto a hawk, was now akin to the void.
