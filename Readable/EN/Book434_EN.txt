Thus, the Mistress of Pushpavatika spoke again:
"Benevolent Princess, if your sincerity is true,"
"Then allow me to recite the first riddle."
"What is cold as the dead while alive,"
"Yet gives warmth upon death?"

That princess of (...) answered thusly:
"You speak of the fragile rose of late spring. Even when covered in thorns, her beauty shines through."
"Her flowers plucked to make perfume, her stems snipped into the wicks of oil lamps."
"Lovers throughout history have been smitten by her, and even the king in red admires her beauty."
"But the rose has never pined for anyone. She merely withers with the new moon and morning dew."

The Mistress of Pushpavatika secretly approved, yet her beautiful face remained as calm as ever.
Taking a casual step forward, she recited the second riddle.

So said the Mistress of Pushpavatika:
"O wise Princess, you have answered my first riddle."
"But from the stars to the abyss, many inexplicable secrets still exist in the world."
"O wise Princess, if your wisdom is truly as the legends of the people say,"
"Please answer my second riddle as you did the first."
"What rises from the earth, then descends from the sky,"
"No one has seen it, yet it sees all,"
"As above, so below, and as at the bottom, so too, the top,"
"Yet only top to bottom may be, and never bottom to top?"

That princess of (...) answered thusly:
"You speak of the universal law created in heaven, the divine laws established in the beginning."
"No one has seen the eternal law, yet it governs all."
"One may only bow down and worship Vaana of the heavenly spirits â€” no arrogation, deception, or trickery is permitted."
"If one dares to imitate the forbidden arts, only calamity awaits at the edge of divine knowledge."
