Rangi Nui's End is my hometown,
And whenever I recall my ancestral lands,
The morning sun shines over Rangi Nui,
Looking out over Waiata, the spring of flowing song,
Looking down upon Te Pahau, the wind-whiskered valley,
Looking across Poheka, the land of abundance,
Such are the lands of my grandparents,
Such is Rangi Nui's End.

I will journey to visit my ancestral home,
On the twenty-fifth night, when the eels begin their dance,
From Ohauiti shall I set forth, where the wind is gentle on the plains,
To the waterfall where sharks do leap, to the shallow shoals,
To Titiwha, those dazzling radiant depths,
Where I shall climb the mountain bathed in sunlight,
To visit the long-slumbering master of mountain and stream,
To explore the ancient dwelling place of the long-forgotten pygmies,
Before descending, descending into the valley's deepest depths,
Down to Te Tahutama, where luminescent fish congregate,
Down to Aka-aka, where plants grow small and strange.
Down to Mahinini, where the dark currents flow soft yet sharp,
Then down to dark Uropi, the depths of the forest...

Wo-ho! Wo-ho!
These distant, far-off lands, the hometown of my grandparents,
They were thrown down, destroyed by disaster and violence, like collapsing mountains and raging wildfires...
My ancestors once lived in prosperity and peace, yet were plunged into famine and exile,
My heart cries out for them, I mourn their tragic fate,
Like unquenchable flame roiling beneath spring waters, so profound a resentment, so deep a sorrow!
Ever shall I wander along that never-ending wellspring of sighs,
And I shall come to fields of mottled green â€” that my ancestors called Kahotea.
And like the ancient dragons, soar effortlessly to the mountains where chants abound...
The lost envoys of the heavens built there a city of gold and stone,
But it was destroyed when raging flame fell from the heavens, the fury of the ancient sovereign.
Wo-ho! Wo-ho!

And so I wander on, to Poheka, the land of abundance,
There Rangi Nui once stood upright between heaven and earth, so the ancestors say,
For he was both a sage who spoke to the heavens, and a hero of the land,
Whose soul returned to the rising sun, whereupon the sky itself became Rangi Nui.
Then, I shall head from the land of abundance to the distant shore,
And on a shore overgrown with tendrils, conclude my final journey.

I once climbed the lonely, desolate volcano,
I have seen countless hot springs with my own eyes,
And I shall head to the other side of the dark currents,
To seek the ferryman, who rows a dugout canoe and wears a gold-feathered crown,
And when at last I see that circlet, glimmering in gold,
Then shall I again reunite with my kin in the garden of Hairinei,
The birthplace of the forgotten sovereign of humans,
And I shall gather my tribespeople and friends, and we shall go there together.
