1
00:00:01,472 --> 00:00:05,400
When lightning flashes, it casts a shadow

2
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:11,325
My name means shadow

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,800
With my blade, I purged all obstacles to progress

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,625
And yet... something was lost

5
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,075
With each step forward

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,700
In the end, I even lost her

7
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,714
The tales are still retold

8
00:00:38,714 --> 00:00:41,150
In the shade of every Thunder Sakura

9
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,975
But the wounds left on our nation by that terrible loss

10
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,725
Still ache

11
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:54,447
"Never stop searching, even if only for a brief flash of light"

12
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:58,450
"If nothing else, we have the present moment"

13
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:00,975
She said that once

14
00:01:03,788 --> 00:01:06,100
But I've seen a nation stride forward

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,651
And lose everything to the Heavenly Principles

16
00:01:10,124 --> 00:01:12,950
Perhaps only if time stands still

17
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,675
Will the lightning's glow never fade

18
00:01:17,612 --> 00:01:20,550
The present moment is a fragile illusion

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,750
Only Eternity can bring us closer to the Heavenly Principles

20
00:01:26,094 --> 00:01:28,175
I am no longer the shadow

21
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,200
"Mine is the most supreme and noble form"

22
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:35,575
"Let power over the realm be vested within me"

23
00:01:36,812 --> 00:01:39,950
"In this form shall I honor my subjects' dream"

24
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:44,325
"For a land of Eternity, unchanging forevermore"
