1
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:16,875
Dear me

2
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:18,875
Aren't you cutting it rather close?

3
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,700
Miko

4
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:24,850
This was your doing...?

5
00:00:27,325 --> 00:00:28,159
Now, now

6
00:00:29,077 --> 00:00:30,350
Don't forget who taught you

7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,525
How to place your consciousness in objects

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,625
Surely you don't think

9
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:36,832
Your ambition alone

10
00:00:36,832 --> 00:00:39,725
Is enough to shake Ei's will? Do you?

11
00:00:41,773 --> 00:00:43,675
Though you alone are here

12
00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:45,850
They too have ambitions

13
00:00:46,175 --> 00:00:48,225
Which they long since entrusted to you

14
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:54,400
Now then

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,000
Close your eyes

16
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:22,642
Abolish the Vision Hunt Decree
