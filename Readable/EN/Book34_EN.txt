At that moment, the Pale Princess was in a deep slumber and had not an inkling of how the pygmies had played her and her lover for fools. Under the cover of the night sky, the six pygmies made their first move.
The poison had sent the Prince into a coma as the Pale Princess slept. The six pygmies' scheme started to unfold.
In her sleep, the Princess had no idea how the Prince was being tortured. In her dream, her lover's body glowed with luminous colors and light scattered gently like satin. The sweet sunlight finally broke through the dark clouds and sprinkled on the living. The orange glow of the setting sun painted a layer of caramel on the blue lake, making the water as sweet as nectar. New colors were painted on the black hills and the ruined city was turned into a candy castle. However, when the Princess called the Prince by name, all she heard in reply were indistinguishable words.
The poor Princess had no idea that the Prince could no longer respond to her calling.
Lightning flashed and thunder echoed in the silent night sky. The six pygmies carried out their scheme successfully. To celebrate, they set up a huge pot and cooked a pot of thick soup with moss and poisonous mushrooms. But just as the culprits were enjoying their feast, the Prince's broken soul used up all its remaining power to curse the pygmies. For the rest of their lives, they were tormented by a curse that made them feel as if they were being cooked in a huge cooking pot, unable to ever see the light of day again.
However, during the celebration, one of the pygmies wrapped the Prince in the dirty tablecloth, intent on carrying him back to the dark forest to seek help from the Princess, hoping to wake him up. No one knows if this was out of a lingering sense of loyalty to the Princess, or simplyÂ born of his fear of the curse.
