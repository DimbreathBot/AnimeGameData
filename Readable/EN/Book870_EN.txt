...As a Treasure Hoarder, I shouldn't be leaving records, but since we recruited through all kinds of different channels for this treasure hunt, we hereby leave this record to prevent an unfair division of the spoils...

...Our destination is the town of Petrichor, where it is said the secret treasure of the Liliacruces Ordo lies, and where the legendary Faded Castle is said to be located. But more importantly, according to the intel I collected, it's also the final refuge of the legendary bandit Juliano...

...Utterly baffling. Could a tiny island like that somehow be some kind of bottomless treasure-swallowing pit? Still, no matter what, this time I'm sure we'll find something...

...The voyage has been going smoothly. To make things easier, I decided to head into town disguised as an adventurer. I hope the rest of the crew can keep their tempers in check...

(The next few pages are illegible, having been repeatedly scribbled over. In the next legible section, the handwriting seems to be completely different from before.)

...Ahaha! We made off like bandits this time! Though there were a few wrinkles, we nicked many of the Dark Lord's treasures. Next, we return to our village in the north to recruit soldiers and purchase horses. We'll show those lunatics following Erinnyes just who has the right to rule the Fontaine to come...

...How many days have passed? Three? No land to be seen, and nothing but sea fog as far as the eye can see...

...Has it been ten days, or nine? I can no longer tell. We tossed out most of our supplies to make room for more treasure, and our food is running short...

...Damnation! None of this is treasure at all, it's nothing but rocks, rocks! What have we done? How did it come to this...
