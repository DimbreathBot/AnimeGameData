A traditional witch's pointed hat with a large brim.
It grants a witch the reverence and fear which she commands.

To the Crimson Witch of Flame, this large hat shielded her from surrounding distractions.
It was how she was able to hone her Pyro skills when she was still an apprentice.

In combat, she needed not pay attention to monsters disintegrating in flames.
Nor did she need to look at her own burnt face in the water's reflection.
And so the Crimson Witch continued to burn, blind to the extent of her devastation.
