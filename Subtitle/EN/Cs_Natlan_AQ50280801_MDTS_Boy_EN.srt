1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:06,325
Listen

2
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:15,679
Did they...

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,900
Lose?

4
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,575
No... It can't be...

5
00:00:18,775 --> 00:00:20,650
Aâ€”Ah... Ah...

6
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:27,504
We...

7
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:30,653
Are the inheritors of memory and legend!

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,100
Those

9
00:00:34,362 --> 00:00:37,025
Who grew alongside sun and wind!

10
00:00:40,152 --> 00:00:40,988
Those

11
00:00:40,988 --> 00:00:43,374
Who forged our own destiny and future!

12
00:00:44,082 --> 00:00:45,758
That is Natlan's fire

13
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,710
The lifeblood of our nation!

14
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:07,508
Their voices

15
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:08,756
I hear them

16
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,497
In the beginning

17
00:01:12,193 --> 00:01:13,584
There was darkness

18
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:16,863
Until someone set themselves aflame

19
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:19,134
Only then

20
00:01:19,957 --> 00:01:22,058
Did the universe know light

21
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:39,160
We won't give up "hope"

22
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:41,293
We will march forward together

23
00:01:42,307 --> 00:01:45,092
This is where we forge our future...

24
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:48,948
With our own two hands!
