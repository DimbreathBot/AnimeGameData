...Finally here. Ochkanatlan. This ancient city, now occupied by a violent and evil dragon, and the final resting place of ██...

...If Aunt Liriwu knew, she'd be in quite the huff, that's for sure. But there's no other way. Even if they say I shouldn't take on the regrets of generations past, I still want to finish this...

...It's fine, no need to be nervous. You've already had a lot of adventures, right? You're a seasoned adventurer, so it'll all be okay! Not to mention, it's been so long, maybe that nasty dragon has long since vanished...

...Anyway, this is where it starts! My adventure...
