Dear {NICKNAME} and Paimon:\nIt's been a while since you left Fontaine for Natlan. How have your travels been going?\nWord on the street says that they held a very special Pilgrimage this time. I'd love to have applied for a foreign press pass to come over and give you this photo too, but the Speaker's Chamber rejected The Steambird's applications — guess the Pilgrimage was just that special, huh? Anyway, we wound up getting Katheryne and the Adventurers' Guild to pass it on to you.\nWith any luck, you'll receive it in time — and it wouldn't hurt for you to drop by Fontaine from time to time either. I'm sure everyone would be glad to have you.\n<right>Your Faithful Friend,</right> <right>Charlotte</right>
