You who come after us:
If there was a prayer in praise of the night, then I would sing its third strain in memory of the poisoned.
For Rabeed, who shall not wake again.
"Woe unto those spiked tails, those sand dunes that nurture malice. They drag across your throat in your mournful sleep, and thus shall you never again walk under the sun."
Rabeed was set upon in his sleep by a scorpion.
It was an agonizing torture beyond words. The venom caused his breathing to weaken, to which the scratching about his throat was testament.
I said that this was a cursed journey and that we should return.
But even the deaths of several comrades cannot stop these people. They have been ensnared by this keystone. It has sucked the light from their path, so they cannot see.
You who come after us â€” if you have read till here, turn back, I bid you, and swiftly!
