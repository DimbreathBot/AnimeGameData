1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:06,272
The samurai was about twenty-five years old when they met at the festival

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,800
They met again ten years later

3
00:00:10,025 --> 00:00:12,125
And remained friends

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,575
They spent time together drinking, traveling, and sparring...

5
00:00:16,925 --> 00:00:19,935
When they had first met, they merely respected each other

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,360
But ten years later, they became best friends

7
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:28,011
After another decade, the samurai had reached the pinnacle of his swordsmanship

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,650
And won their duel by a narrow margin

9
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:33,550
Kamai was so astonished by his defeat

10
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:38,075
He gave up drinking and began training to become stronger for their next duel

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,032
However, another ten years later, Kamai did not meet the samurai

12
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:50,075
As it turned out, war had broken out in the South, and the samurai had gone to defend the border

13
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:55,725
Kamai was unconcerned, because ten years was nothing

14
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,600
In a youkai's lifetime

15
00:00:58,375 --> 00:00:59,900
But when they met once again

16
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:04,425
Kamai discovered that the samurai was already sixty-five years old

17
00:01:04,575 --> 00:01:10,325
He couldn't believe his eyes when he saw the samurai's gray hair and scars covering his body

18
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:14,304
Hey, old friend. Can you still wield the sword?

19
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,050
I'm getting too old to fight

20
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:23,825
This time, I've come to say goodbye

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,936
I see

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,776
Then how about one last game of Akitsu Hazura (Haneasobi)?

23
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:34,400
Alright

24
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:39,175
The samurai gave his best effort during the game

25
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:42,975
But had to quit halfway through because he was too weak

26
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:48,950
After putting down his hagoita, Kamai remained silent for a long time

27
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,600
Before letting out a long sigh

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,150
*sigh* What a shame
