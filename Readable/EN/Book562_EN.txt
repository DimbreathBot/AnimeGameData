It's been a while. How have you been?
I've heard that the two of you are traveling in Sumeru,
And I happen to be in Port Ormos on official business.

Lately, I've been stopping by Djafar Tavern for a drink or two every afternoon.
If luck's on my side, and this letter successfully reaches you...
Come to me then and we can catch up on old times.
We'll see it as a fated encounter.
