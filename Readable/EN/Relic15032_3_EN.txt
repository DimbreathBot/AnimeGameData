In the solemn silence of the sea's depths, the towering city of the glorious kingdom once stood,
And there, like the sad ghost of a mighty, ancient dream, there stands a faded golden castle.
The majestic opera of that golden era has ended, and its harmonious, united music no longer echoes.
Upon the wreckage of ambition and betrayal, the "people of bygone times" built a realm anew.

"Woe, woe to the perfect order, that has once again been trampled by barbarity. The weak and benighted have overtaken the empire's ancient lands!"
"The spirits and the springs, the springs and the chevaliers... The ravings of children have replaced the epic poems, slipshod ditties have supplanted music."
"The eternal majesty was ruined by a moment of the God King's madness, and the resurgent savages scorn its memory..."
"Must great realms be reclaimed by savagery in the end? In the end, shall folly and ignorance prevail over civilization and reason?"

Upon the golden theater in that faded castle, thus did musicians who had lost their score cry lamentation for a past that would never return,
And the silent, famished golems listened, waiting to hunt and devour the innocent souls.
When the great golden symphony plays once more, the Golden Troupe will receive the rightful rewards owed to the true and loyal.
When the perfect order separates humanity into master and servant, prosperity and beauty shall make the kingdom glorious once more...
Abide until that day... Abide until that day...
When every member of the Golden Troupe shall win the whole future as their prize.
