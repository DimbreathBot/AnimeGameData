...With the power of Amrita and Khvarena, we have extinguished the phantoms mirroring the bedeviled sky...
...Praise be the spirits of the light, praise be the protection of the Dahri! It is thanks to them that our grand cause has come to fruition...
...The Khvarena is without beginning or end, the Amrita is neither created nor destroyed, but must be kept pure through ritual prayer...
...Let the inscription here serve as a warning. All who come after, be diligent and brave, fall not to decadence and neglect...
