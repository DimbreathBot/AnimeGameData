What do you suppose would be a writer's greatest regret?
"To... leave a story without an ending?"
Such was Alice's reply, as one who had been touched by such regret all too often in her sojourns across many worlds.
An author who had toiled for decades might suddenly pass away due to acute illness, leaving an epic tale of swords and sorcery frozen before the final battle... Or perhaps a brilliantly gifted author, their time limited by some malady, may find themselves never able to fully present their grand imagined world to their readers...
Alice, who loved reading, was deeply troubled by this and couldn't help but sigh.
"My greatest regret is that every story I write has to come to an end in the first place."
This was the answer that Anya "Marie" Andersdotter, one who had authored many a fairy tale, gave.
She glanced back at the bookshelf, where many characters born from her pen slumbered between the pages. Some were clever or brave, winning the hearts of many readers with their outstanding performances.
But no matter how brilliantly a character shines, the moment their story ends, their potential is lost forever.
For them, the story itself becomes an inescapable fate.
Looking at the books, now covered in a thin layer of dust from being sealed away for so long, Alice understood her friend's regret.
"Anya..."
"But what if instead, I could place my pen in their hand and let them continue the story themselves?"
Anya's gaze returned to the manuscript — the last story she would leave behind, and the most special. Other stories would eventually form part of the "past," but this story could have a "future."
Alice quickly understood that this was her friend's final wish.
"...What the writer you are, Anya. Your imagination never ceases to amaze."
"And you do know how much I love a happy ending. You shall have my help, my dear."
