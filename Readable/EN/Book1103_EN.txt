The ship's doctor said Salme needed more time to recover, so I returned to the children's cabin. Salomea was awake — I knew it might be too cruel for her to think back to what happened, but I had to get to the bottom of the night's events.
But when I asked, what she told me shattered my heart. Even now, I can scarcely believe it. As I write this, my hands are shaking. It... It was Salomea! It was Salomea who locked her sister in that dark prison of a cargo crate! This wasn't just some prank! This was something far worse. She had to be punished! No matter what else may have happened, nothing could ever justify doing something so horrifying!

Salomea cried as she begged me to forgive her. She said if she hadn't done what she did, Salme would have left her. She claimed that Salme was the child of a fae. That she wanted to return to the world of her people. That the monster that took the passenger was probably Salme's kin... Nonsense! Utter blather! There can be no doubt that Salme is a human child, no different than Salomea... Though, are there not fae that can transform? A terrifying doubt took root in my heart, before I tore it up and discarded it. Salomea's impressionable mind must have been affected by reading unsuitable stories — just like that lullaby, "Mama in the Sheepfold"...

Even now, I vacillate. Should I pen a letter to the children's father, informing him of Salomea's wicked deed? I cannot say what doing so would mean for the girl... There is no time left to write today — I shall decide what to do tomorrow.
