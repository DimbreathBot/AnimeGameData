"The fall is here. The season of harvest is almost upon us."
The one speaking was Saitou Onisa.

Ninjas are dangerous individuals, experts in self-preservation and in avoiding danger. In times of war and upheaval, they work as mercenaries for the Daimyo.
They are born in war, and they draw their strength from the powerful masters they work for. Such is the path of the ninja.
But it is also the path of the ninja to become displaced and disillusioned at the end of a war, or to meet their ruin as soon as they lose their powerful backing.

So when the Imagawa Tai-Shogun finally united the country, the ninjas became like hunting dogs that had outlived their purpose. Most were either executed or drafted into the shogun's army, but some got away, disappeared into the wilderness, and turned to a life of banditry.
That is precisely Saitou Onisa's story.

"There's no rush. Let's wait for the villagers to finish harvesting the grain for us."
The person speaking this time was called Yonemata Tasuke.

Bandits are either samurai who have grown weary of the warrior's way or farmers fighting to stay alive.
They, too, are born in war. They draw their strength from cunning, and this emboldens them to run amok across the land.
But when the war ends and peace is restored, the source of their power evaporates. Like mayflies, they disappear as quickly as they came.

Yonemata Tasuke was born into an ordinary farming family, only turning to banditry in his forties. Yet, despite his age, he took to it with great aplomb, and quickly established himself as a ringleader.
The most terrible of all bandits are those who have themselves suffered terribly under an oppressive hand.

"Then, we burn everything. Leave no survivors."

His was the voice of an age of upheaval.
