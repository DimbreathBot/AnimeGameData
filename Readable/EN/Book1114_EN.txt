Data from the tenth experiment on the barrier generator's stability has been fully compiled. Results remain unsatisfactory as energy is still depleting too quickly.
...
The experiment was relocated to a different site, but a Landcruiser became damaged due to an operational error. Chaos ensued. Data was successfully recovered, but additional time had to be spent filing the incident report.
