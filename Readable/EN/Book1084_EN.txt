Dear Friend:
Should you read this request for aid, please head to the Clink-Clank Krumkake Craftshop as soon as you can.
Please forgive the sudden request. A heretofore unseen crisis has descended, and my simulations confirm that the Craftshop's chances of destruction have increased by 10.3%, with the chances of Nod-Krai as a whole being destroyed having increased by 2.6%. These developments are what have prompted the request.
The situation is urgent, and I have decided to face this crisis down alone first. The chance that I will not return is 83%, which is why I have left this here.
Once again, please head to the Clink-Clank Krumkake Craftshop as soon as you can. Thank you very much!
