In the near future, a meeting of thieves will take place in the caves beneath Inazuma City.
This meeting is expected to take place <color=#00E1FFFF>late at night and end sometime before dawn.</color>
There will two parties in this meeting. One consists of traitors who are stealing army supplies to line their own pockets.
The other is a gang of thieves and smugglers that has formed in recent years.

Send in the Shuumatsu to end traitors and criminals alike.
