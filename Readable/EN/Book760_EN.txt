Part XVII: Movement Mechanism Design Iterations
In short, based on the Full System Prototype tests, simply increasing the dimensions of existing humanoid clockwork meka is not technologically feasible.
This meka is required to, ideally, be able to operate across various types of terrain, including hard city roads, dense woodlands, beaches, and even muddy swamps.
If the bipedal locamotion of humanoid meka is adopted, the meka would be considered a total loss upon entering environments with loose and soft soil. It would be impossible to recover it with Fontaine's current transportation capabilities.
This problem is due to the weight of the power system and the combat system far exceeding our expectations.
Currently, a power system capable of driving this meka is still under development, so we have been forced to use multiple, connected mass-produced clockwork meka cores, and the power-to-weight ratio is quite low.
But even if it is replaced with an optimized power system, the meka's total weight will not decrease significantly.
The combat system's weight is crucial. In order to ensure combat capabilities meet the prescribed goals, the armor, weapons, and ammunition cannot be reduced in either size or weight. Otherwise, we would only be weakening the meka further.
Thus, a multi-wheel structure or the Crawler Track Movement Mechanism being designed by another research group is a far more realistic design proposition than humanoid legs.
If a track with considerable width is utilized, the meka will be able to traverse various adverse terrain while maintaining the highest combat efficiency.
Furthermore, the tests run on the Full System Prototype validated a basic conjecture:
"Weight is the parameter of all man-made meka and equipment. When the right parts are utilized, weight is equal to combat power. As such, weight should be made a priority when designing any meka."
The results derived from this theory will be presented by our project team at the conference.
