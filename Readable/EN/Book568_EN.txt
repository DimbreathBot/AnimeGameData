It does not make sense. There must be something wrong.
I must admit that I have encountered some extraordinary artists ever since I left the studio.
I also admit that they can surpass the masters even without using any particularly famous technique... Albeit with some trick to it, I'm sure!
And I am all too aware that my works are not yet the equal of those created by my stubborn teachers, nor would I be able to debate the literati who critique art.
But it's only a matter of time! I am still young, and they are at least two years older than I.
Surely, I am no one's inferior in talent or vision!
Surely, I cannot still be inferior to these emblems of mediocrity even after so much practice!
And surely, I am not like them, who despite their skills, still cannot find a way to depict the lights, shadows, and lines that capture me!
Time! Time is all I need, and I shall produce a masterwork that will cause all their jaws to drop!
Next, I must concentrate on honing my skills with a brush and begin my training in earnest.
But first, I must collect enough funds. Spending too much energy on earning a living on the road shall beggar my efforts, after all.
I've heard it said that you can encounter a wondrous fairy that can make wishes come true in the Sumeru desert. Perhaps that fairy's help shall see me complete my goal in the shortest time possible...
If luck is with me, I might even gain more than that.
I should get my things in order. I must go to find the fairy as soon as possible...
