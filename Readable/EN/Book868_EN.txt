May your melody find peace, kindhearted Euergetia, my colleague, my friend, my sister.
Though your beneficence be forgotten, though your name be forgotten, here the flowers shall always bloom for you.
Sleep, sleep, worry no more for the past, weep no more for the future, and laugh as you once did.
â€”Ouranides of Ouranopolis
