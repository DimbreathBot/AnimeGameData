1
00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:06,300
What is to be sung transpired in days of yore

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,113
When the divine archons still walked the earth

3
00:00:10,113 --> 00:00:13,950
A dragon cast his curious gaze on the world below

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,930
As he parted from the heavens that gave his birth

5
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:20,400
The dragon sought truth amongst common folk

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,400
But mortal trifles only fogged his mind

7
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:27,400
The windborne bard strummed his strings dolce

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,500
And the Holy Lyre answered his questions kind

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,675
The dragon was but a child full of wonder

10
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:36,925
And soared the heavens free from care

11
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:41,425
The bard's songs invited him to sing along

12
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:45,325
For he yearned to let all perceive him fair

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,200
Enchanting legends the bard and dragon were

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,900
But the tides of despair soon engulfed the land

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,000
The lion fang perished and the falcon flag slept

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,550
As a vile dragon approached Mondstadt in lone stand

17
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:06,050
Over the Cathedral loomed death and his friends

18
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:11,075
Of the people's agony the bard soon sang

19
00:01:11,075 --> 00:01:14,675
The soaring dragon heeded his grave calls

20
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:18,622
And amidst the windstorms a brutal war sprang

21
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:27,150
Blood of venom sent the sky dragon into slumber

22
00:01:28,975 --> 00:01:32,825
Only to awake to be expelled in abhor

23
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,025
"Why do people in this age loathe me so?"

24
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,875
But the Holy Lyre replied no more

25
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,050
Wrath and woe, vigor and venom

26
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,250
Poured from the dragon's bitter eyes

27
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:58,225
The dragon's curse sprawled in silence

28
00:01:58,225 --> 00:02:02,575
But the Lyre could no longer soothe his cries
