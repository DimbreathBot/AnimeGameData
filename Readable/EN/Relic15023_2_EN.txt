Legend has it that a hero once plucked an eagle's feather from atop the highest cliff of The Chasm.
It is also said that those who could accomplish such a deed earned the right to die alongside the adepti.

"Going to one's death willingly in defense of the people... A good cause indeed."
"Yet, if you think about it, this would be akin to a fish sinking into a deep pool or a bird plummeting into a forge."
"I may yet achieve my own desire, but we shall go unknown, and ultimately unremembered."
"Mortals like us are like feathers caught up in a whirlwind, floating into the deep sky."
"Saving, defending... In the end, these are all pointless things, void of meaning."

These dark murmurings shook the hearts of those who would never make a name for themselves.

But the battle was over in the end, and many a soldier would rest eternally in the cavernous depths.
The freakish cries of the dark forces were also silenced like fading ripples...
And though mortal spans are short, the land will forever remember.
