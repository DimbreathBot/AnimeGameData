...You must believe, brethren...

...The great Pyro Archon Xbalanque's light guides us, and our victory is inevitable...

...

...Listen not to the chaotic rumors spread by tale-tellers in the wilderness, and heed neither the words of false gods nor the rebellion of the golden-eyed...

...The only one we should worship is him, for he is the one true king who is of "humanity," the one true "human" god...

...The true god shall never die... Glory eternal...
