A collection of hilichurl poetry compiled by the Mondstadt ecologist Jacob Musk. During the writing of this book, Musk traveled across the continent to visit every hilichurl tribe, even going so far as to venture deep into hilichurl settlements and become intimately acquainted with their lives. Musk was praised as the "Poet Laureate of Hilichurlian" for this book, but it is evident that neither the scholar himself nor the hilichurls were particularly fond of this honor. Jacob Musk, though enthusiastic about hilichurl studies, loathed to be associated with them even in his late years.

The first song:
Mi muhe ye
Mi biat ye
Biat ye dada
Muhe dada

Quite possibly a battle song sung by the hilichurls before combat. I have observed that when two or more hilichurls are present, they engage in frenzied brawling after singing this vulgar song.

The second poem:
Eleka mimi-a-Domu
Mita domu-a-dada
La-la-la
La-la-la
Mimi mosi ye mita

The song is sung by hilichurls as they dance around totem poles. In my estimation it is some form of tribal hymn. It has an upbeat tone and is usually heard during festivals.

The third poem:
Mi muhe mita nye
Mi muhe mita nye
Muhe nye
Muhe nye
Gusha
Biat, gusha

A melancholic hilichurl song I heard during an exchange with an elderly samachurl. Although I do not yet understand the literal meaning of the poem, the overwhelming sense of grief that comes through in the song is enough to captivate the best poets in my birthplace (despite such praise, I must admit the acrid smells coming from the elderly hilichurls were just as melancholic, and just as overwhelming).
