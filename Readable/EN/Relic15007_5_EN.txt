An exquisite pocket watch made of sapphire.
It remains functional even after all these years.

The pocket watch of a noble who once ruled over Mondstadt. The time it tells is still accurate.
Punctuality is a virtue, and this pocket watch helped the nobles stay on a virtuous path.
It was more for self-discipline than a tool to influence the common folk.
At daybreak, a worthy noble must be more vigilant than his people.
At night, he should be more thoughtful and restless than they.

Over the years, the once-strict schedule was overturned by their indolent descendants.
Their timepieces grew more extravagant, but lost their virtuous function.
