1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,392
In Old Mondstadt transpired the story to be told

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,744
Where a tyrant ruled, I met a boy, not that old

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,800
The lyre he played, and for a song he sought

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:18,368
But storm-walls blocked blue sky â€” he was sincerely distraught

5
00:00:19,072 --> 00:00:21,950
"I do so wish to see the birds in flight"

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:25,344
Said he, his strong eyes filling with light

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,800
But his voice was lost in the howling wind's churn

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,792
For the whirlwind takes, and gives naught in return

9
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:39,104
The true sky, and songs that cageless soar...

10
00:00:39,552 --> 00:00:42,688
Were they not wishes worth fighting for?

11
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,825
So the boy turned, extending his hand:

12
00:00:45,825 --> 00:00:50,275
"Let us cast down the tyrant and his walls from this land"

13
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:53,376
The young boy raised then the flag of revolt

14
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:56,350
And I threw myself into freedom's tumult

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,520
Victorious were we who fought to be free

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,680
Gods fell, winds whipped, nations shook violently

17
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:09,184
In the smoke, a despot met his doom

18
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,000
And we watched as his great tower fell none too soon

19
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:18,784
Mondstadt began anew, the story passed down

20
00:01:19,488 --> 00:01:23,264
And since then never has another worn its crown
