Naoko-sensei passed away today... This makes me the final traveling doctor still left on this island ever since the Tatarigami outbreak began.
It pains me to watch as the people who stayed behind on the island fall to illness one after another. There is nothing I can do about the Tatarigami's corruption but to continue the self-deception of making sweet Lavender Melon soup for people...

"Care is also a form of remedy."
...Sensei always used to say that, but it's just a thing that medical professionals like ourselves say to make ourselves feel better...
