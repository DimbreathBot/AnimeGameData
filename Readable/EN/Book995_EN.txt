O you who have traversed foreign lands to reach this placeâ€”
Mount up on Khamu-at, ride the black stag.
May the light-feathers upon the floating sea shield you.
May the swaying branches and leaves of heaven's tree protect you.
Forth, go forth, for the scepter is in your hand.
Forth, go forth, for starlight shall adorn your name.
