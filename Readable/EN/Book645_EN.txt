The Tale of the Donkey

Even when dressed to the nines, a Plain Jane will rarely be mistaken for a socialite.
Everyone in this world has strengths and weaknesses that are theirs and theirs alone.
Thus, the only way forward is to know oneself and face one's own flaws.
Don't be like the donkey of this tale, and make an ass of oneself.

Having learned how the fox seized the cheese, the donkey sought to emulate the crafty fox.
"Why is the world like this?"
"The fox is no genius. Why do others always toot her horn?"
"Do I, the donkey, not labor every day? Yet, no one cares to even greet me with a smile."
"Since this is the case, I shall learn from the fox and do the same as she."
"Her little tricks, surely, shall be mine in no time."

Thus, the donkey hid among the trees, and waited for its target to come by.
As the daughter of the cheesemaker passed by, the donkey bounded over,
And imitating the fox, raised a hoof and said with a smug voice,
"Ha! Listen to me! You know nothing about swift travel."
"Just throw all your cheese away. Shall your cart not arrive sooner that way?"

The young lady was shocked, and she immediately replied,
"Oh, you silly donkey! You dare to try to pull my leg?"
"Get me my stick! I'm driving this beast back to the mill!"
Seeing the stick being waved at it, the donkey ceased speaking at once.

This tale explains how trying to be someone else and smothering your own identity,
Is by no means beneficial. Indeed, it only leads to more suffering.
