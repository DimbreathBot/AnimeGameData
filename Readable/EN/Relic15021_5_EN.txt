He was originally born to be a vessel for a "heart."
But he shed tears in his dreams.
His creator observed thus:
He was too fragile, whether it be as a human or as a tool.

Yet his creator would not destroy him, and so allowed him to continue slumbering.
In her latter works, she would also consign designs that might store such a heart to obsolescence.
Not long after, that noblest and most prestigious "proof" in the world would come to have no home,
And thus was sent to the great shrine at Mt. Yougou.

Later, the beautiful puppet awoke and began his wanderings.
He observed many a heart,
Good ones, upright ones, strong ones, gentle ones...
The puppet, too, desired a heart.

Later, the lovely puppet would finally obtain that "heart."
It was, after all, his purpose for being, the very reason he existed.
Yet, it was not what the puppet truly desired,
For it did not contain any blessings,
But was instead a sacrifice brimming with selfishness, hypocrisy, cunning and curses,
All wrapped in an amiable husk.

Good and evil were the song of sentient life, useless and cacophonous.
But if he were to wrench this "heart" out,
He would no longer be able to feel anything at all...
