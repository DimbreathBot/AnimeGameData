1
00:00:01,825 --> 00:00:04,475
There was a transparent bird made of crystal

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,750
It was beautiful and fragile, and could sing the most beautiful songs

3
00:00:08,973 --> 00:00:12,557
But since mortals couldn't see it, they believed it to be a trick

4
00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:17,485
How could a transparent bird possibly exist, let alone sing?

5
00:00:18,637 --> 00:00:21,197
When the bird heard that, it flapped its wings

6
00:00:21,275 --> 00:00:23,525
And flew across mountains and seas

7
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:27,975
All the way to the night sky, where it turned into a star

8
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:32,525
Its brilliance was so dazzling that it illuminated everyone

9
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:38,100
It allowed all those that could see it to follow its light through the dark night

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,700
To sail through the seas under the guidance of the stars

11
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,150
It was born in wisdom, but trapped in ignorance

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,653
It has never voiced a complaint, for this is its destiny

13
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:53,600
Guiding people to see their destinies is the very meaning of its existence
