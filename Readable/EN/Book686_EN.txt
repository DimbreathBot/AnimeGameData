Dear Mr. Curve, Ms. Talochard, Ms. Paimon, and {M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME},
We've moved! But we thought you might come back, so we've left this for you. Mom says we have to keep our new address a secret for now, so I'll slip it to you next time.
Thanks for straightening me out.
Also, it turns out that Mr. Curve is the kind of person who can't tell a lie! I admire that. He'll always be like a big brother to me!
