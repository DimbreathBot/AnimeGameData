Father! Mother! Forgive me! Forgive your unfilial child!
How blinded I was by the legend of that Lunar Leviathan! To think that I believed that catching some crummy fish would fetch me a rich man's daughter for a wife! Well, there's no getting off this boat now, is there?

If this thrice-be-darned Lunar Leviathan has any heart at all, let it carry my letter to the shore. Please stop waiting for me, Father, Mother. I'm not getting out of this one.

Marry a hawk, and the sky's your hunting ground. Marry a dog, and the earth's your... Err... Actually, how did that saying go again...
