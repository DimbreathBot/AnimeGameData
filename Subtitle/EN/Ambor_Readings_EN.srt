1
00:00:02,525 --> 00:00:06,875
When the first wisp of wind brushed across the land

2
00:00:07,175 --> 00:00:10,500
Birds that yearned for the sky had wings

3
00:00:10,925 --> 00:00:13,125
But no way to fly

4
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,947
They asked the Anemo God:

5
00:00:17,947 --> 00:00:20,500
"How can we reach the heavens?"

6
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:23,500
To which the Anemo God replied:

7
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:28,000
"You have yet to find that which is most important"

8
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:32,300
As the God spoke, the wind thrust the seeds of a dandelion

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,125
High into the sky

10
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:36,850
The birds thrust out their wings

11
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:40,003
But the breeze was all too mild

12
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,825
Leaving them to stumble across the earth

13
00:00:44,275 --> 00:00:45,800
So they went to the gorge

14
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,103
Where the wind showed off its wild and incomparable strength

15
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,425
They threw themselves off the cliff

16
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:56,853
And flapped their wings amongst the howling winds

17
00:00:56,853 --> 00:01:01,103
Until they were able to fly freely in the sky

18
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,975
To the Anemo God they went, to gleefully say:

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,650
"We understand now! All we needed was a stronger wind to fly"

20
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,225
In reply the Anemo God said:

21
00:01:12,525 --> 00:01:15,928
"What you lacked was not wind, but courage"

22
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:21,850
"It is courage that has allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world"
