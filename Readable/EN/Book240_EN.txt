Continuing where we left off, Black Fox Itaru was on her way to the village looking for trouble when she saw two women standing at the side of the road dressed like lumberjacks. Both had three blades hanging from their waist: a seven-foot-long nodachi, a kodachi, and a wakizashi. They were armed to the teeth, and they weren't hiding it.

As her big, bulky silhouette approached from a distance, the ground shook and dust went flying with each step she took â€” all of which put the two women on high alert. They grasped the hilts of their blades, ready to draw them at any moment, and asked in unison:

"Who are you? Are you a youkai!?"

The silhouette answered:

"Haha, that's exactly what I am!"

Without hesitation, the two women immediately drew their swords and stepped forward, intending to slay Itaru. But this was one youkai they had underestimated. She dodged their attacks in a single step, grabbed their wrists, and twisted them as she turned sideways, sending both of their seven-foot-long nodachi clattering to the ground. Alarmed by the pain, the two reached for their kodachi, but they were too late. Itaru sent one of them flying to the ground with an almighty slap, while placing the other into a headlock. Then, she grabbed the one under her arm by the scruff of the neck and lifted her up into the air, placing her foot on the other's chest to pin her to the ground.

"The Twin Oni of Tokaku? Looks like neither of you have learned anything from the beating I gave you last year for harassing the villagers!"

When the two bandits heard this, they panicked and started begging for their lives. Black Fox Itaru threw them to the ground and begin to speak:

"Fair enough. Well, I'm a masterless youkai now that I've been banished from the mountain by Hakushin. Why don't the two of you join me? We'll go around helping those in need. It'll be fun!"
