Ten years earlier...
25 light years away...

With the nation under the rule of the Suruga Shogunate, cries of anguish filled the streets as the people suffered bitterly.
At that time, the Suruga Shogunate was led by the Seii Tai-Shogun, Imagawa Ujizane. Four years prior, after finally beheading Demon King Danjouchuu, the Tai-Shogun's own reign of terror began.
It was in this time and place that our free and unrestrained swordmaster wandered the land.
His name was Bitchuu Kyuubei, and he was known to the people as Shinkurou, the vigilante.
Bitchuu Kyuubei was not a ronin as such. It is said that he was once the most trusted strategist for His Excellency the Tai-Shogun, until one day he was framed by a rival. Given the Shogun's paranoid nature, this left him with no choice but to flee the Shogunate and escape into the wilderness.

Today, Shinkurou was standing on a mountainside gazing into the distance. But what was the object of his gaze?
Was it the vast expanse of open fields? No.
Was it the mountain range in the distance? No.
Was it the road stretching out ahead of him? Yes! Although, that's not the full story.

So. What was the object of Shinkurou's gaze, exactly...?
The farmers who had paid the swordsman in rice for his services cowered in fear, too afraid to ask.

It seems that only the silent swordsman himself knew the answer to this question.
