<center>The sky that night blossomed with flowers,
The stars that night hummed like bees,
In search of nectar and of dreams.
And we, that night, were as new as the dew,
Under moonlight flowing like silken honey,
Our words sweet as we sat by the spring.
But I turned and left you alone,
The poem in my heart left unspoken.
And since then,
The stars do not twinkle, the moon is ice-cold.
I hide them 'neath the water,
But your tears fall and find them.</center>
