Legends tell that in a time long past, proud dragons roamed freely across the expanses of Natlan, a land they called their home.
Back then, before the humans of this land had formed their tribes, dragons were both larger and haughtier than the Saurians of the present day.
Just as humans do now, the dragons had different tribes of their own, each ruled by ancient matriarchs.

Its name was Maawe, which in an ancient, long-forgotten language, meant "bit of string."

As far as it was concerned, nothing was more pleasing than cool moonlit nights and the warm shadows of red cliffs.
"Such blatant indolence! How can this be tolerated in the Dragonlord's Palace? The puerile whelp must rediscover the ambition and fury of its noble heritage."
Thus spake the dragon matriarch, decreeing that the young Maawe must leave the tribe to grow up like a "real dragon"â€”
To harden its heart, to become as tenaciously proud as obsidian, and to be guided alone by cruel, lofty ambition...
