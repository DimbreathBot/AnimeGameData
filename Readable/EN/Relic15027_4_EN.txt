Fallen noble, please heed this man so old and blind.
Heed the lessons of Gurabad, heed the evanescence of the flowers made by man.
Heed the king of common birth, and the mad love and boiling fury possessed by the Jinn...

Legend has it that the Lord of the Sands made a pact with humanity after the passing of his lover, with the Jinn as his envoys.

Once a shepherd, Ormazd had now become the vassal king, proxy of the Lord of the Sands.
Yet, even as the flowers bloomed and their fragrance filled the air, who would have thought that...
The most bitter and violent demise was to follow the most vibrant bloom.

Following the old tales told to him by his master, Xiphos began his journey to the city of sapphires,
Toward the lessons buried beneath the sands of yesteryear, which he would in future find repeated as the winds of infinite time blew...
