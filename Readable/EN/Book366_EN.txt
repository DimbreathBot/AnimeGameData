Perhaps this is a message left for me by that friend who helped me out before.
Thanks for your message, but I don't see anything worthwhile in that room anyway, so I won't enter it. Thanks again for your help.
I don't know how you knew that I wanted to go to Dragonspine. I appreciate your good intentions, but I'm an adventurer too.
I know I may not make it back from this journey, but I still want to go, because Dragonspine lies that way.
