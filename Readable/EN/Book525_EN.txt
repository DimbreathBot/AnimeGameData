...They say that Jinn-powered machines fill that giant labyrinth...
...From morning till night, they drive the screaming Jinn with nine-tailed whips... and so the Jinn pull, grind, and turn, and so do all things flow from the machines like water...
...But what of those people? Do those who stand guard by the machines day and night, whips in hand, scream too?
...And what sorts of whips do those who drive the guards on carry?
