1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,425
...Menogias, where have you been?

2
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:12,700
Brother Yaksha, you're confused again

3
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:16,477
I've told you countless times, I am Boyang

4
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,575
A thaumaturge who fought with you in The Chasm

5
00:00:20,381 --> 00:00:23,800
Boyang...? Boyang?

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,475
You are Boyang, but who am I?

7
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:33,950
Believe me, I wanna know as much as you do

8
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,850
Here we are, the two who agreed to stay here together

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,025
And I can't even call you by your name

10
00:00:39,425 --> 00:00:40,833
It's a shame

11
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,591
...Stay here? 

12
00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:46,950
No, no, you have to leave

13
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:50,979
Nonsense, Brother Yaksha

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,896
We're down here for good now, don't you remember?

15
00:00:55,225 --> 00:00:57,400
...It's too late to have regrets!

16
00:00:57,825 --> 00:00:59,950
The seal can't be broken...

17
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:05,250
...The seal... ah, yes

18
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,800
I'm... a yaksha who came here to fight

19
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,850
...Brother, brother! Are you okay?

20
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:21,275
...Haha, look at the state of me. I don't think I've got long now!

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,296
We're the only two left. Don't go dying on me!

22
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,625
...You know, today I saw my family down here, clear as day

23
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:38,500
What do you think, am I losing my mind now, too?

24
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:43,978
Boyang, do you want to go home?

25
00:01:46,986 --> 00:01:52,200
I made my decision to leave Rongzhao up on the surface, I obviously...

26
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:56,600
Of course I want to go home

27
00:01:58,275 --> 00:02:02,550
...I must have family, too

28
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:07,025
You mean, brothers and sisters? I'm sure you do

29
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:09,475
Brothers and sisters...

30
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:16,850
Yes, but who am I? And where is my family?

31
00:02:18,273 --> 00:02:21,550
I'm... Brother! What's wrong? 

32
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:24,850
Hang in there... It's just you and me, don't...

33
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:27,350
Don't die before me...

34
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,230
...Alatus... Is that you?

35
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:38,575
Who's Alatus? Your memory's going again... ugh...

36
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,000
...I'm sorry you all have to see me in this state

37
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:46,000
Brother... Brother!

38
00:02:46,975 --> 00:02:50,837
...Look... There's someone over there...

39
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,280
Who are they...

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,552
They're... they're my... my...

41
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,292
I remember now, I know you...

42
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,925
...My brothers and sisters have come for me, Boyang

43
00:03:22,975 --> 00:03:25,775
You're... you're awake?

44
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:29,725
At least... at least tell me your name!

45
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:31,205
Brother!

46
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,625
Brother Bosacius!

47
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,525
Hey, Bosacius!

48
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:36,700
Bosacius

49
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:37,350
I...

50
00:03:38,925 --> 00:03:41,500
I am Bosacius

51
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,425
And my destiny

52
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:48,050
Is to make the ultimate sacrifice
