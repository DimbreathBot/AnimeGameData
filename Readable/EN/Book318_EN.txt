Magic engraved on Subrosium does not wear off easily. Some believe the stone to be a bridge between the living and the dead.

However finding Subrosium is no easy matter. You need to be at the right place at the right time.

Legend has it that you may find Subrosium if you stand in the middle of the lake south of Mt. Tianheng at <color=#00E1FFFF>dusk</color> and look in the direction of <color=#00E1FFFF>the setting sun</color>.
