1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,200
The light turned into...

2
00:00:08,275 --> 00:00:09,650
A seed?

3
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:12,400
The miracle tree that blesses the people

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,800
In this moment new to the world and yet to be known

5
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:17,500
When to plant it

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,950
Where it shall bloom...

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,900
She who brings it into being must let her heart and dreams decide

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,250
Grant it life

9
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:26,400
Ei

10
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:27,625
Is this...

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,400
Is it really...

12
00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:43,575
Eternity extends time into infinity

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,200
Dreams illuminate each moment within

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,750
When both shine in unison

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,175
The Sacred Sakura blooms from the darkness

16
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:55,725
Finally free from the clutches of the Heavenly Principles

17
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:56,500
Now

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,325
The nightmare has dissipated

19
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:00,625
And reality is made whole

20
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:04,350
The vision we both yearn for is still further ahead

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,200
My only regret

22
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,975
Is that I cannot witness Inazuma's future

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,575
Nor can I walk this journey with you

24
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:18,725
Do you know

25
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:19,475
Ei

26
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,550
I am so happy right now

27
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:24,225
Because my final wish has now come true

28
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,050
Your polearm once protected me from countless calamities

29
00:01:28,325 --> 00:01:28,925
For this

30
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,175
I've always felt indebted to you

31
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,850
Though I could never repay you in full

32
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:36,575
This Sacred Sakura will buy you some time

33
00:01:36,675 --> 00:01:38,675
Until you are ready to awaken

34
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:40,325
And embrace the new

35
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:42,725
What do you think?

36
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:44,425
Did it do the trick?

37
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,475
This time

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,375
It really is goodbye

39
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,500
Ei

40
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,425
 

41
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:03,250
Goodbye

42
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,550
Makoto
