Introduction
Since Monsieur Bossuet became the supervisor of the Bossuet Research Institute (formerly known as Alain Guillotin Memorial Research Institute), his flawless decisions and wise leadership have led to remarkable results in multiple research areas.
Out of respect and in gratitude to Monsieur Bossuet (Note: I am absolutely not being mandated to do this by Monsieur Bossuet himself), his highly original research results shall be collected here for future reference.

Title: Theoretical Analysis and Design of the Novel Artificed Core Configuration
Authors: Bossuet and Chisseray
Introduction: This paper introduces a new theoretical artificed core configuration, elaborates on the operating principle and design requirements of the configuration, and compares it to the traditional configuration (Guillotin Configuration). Calculations show that in an ideal situation, the configuration's optimal output is slightly higher than the traditional one.

Remarks:
This paper was selected as Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering's Outstanding Paper of the Year, and as a result, Monsieur Bossuet has been awarded the title of Senior Technician.

Title: Research on Synchronous Control and Applications Based on the Novel Artificed Core Configuration
Authors: Bossuet, Maillardet, and Chisseray
Introduction: This paper explores the feasibility of applying the new artificed core configuration to synchronous control and proposes a new mode of artistic expression.

Remarks:
Ugh, if only Maillardet wasn't so obsessed with these weird dancing toys...
