Eichi Karasawa, formal Narzissenkreuz member, Level 1. A scholar from Inazuma staying in Fontaine, he has displayed great fervor for Narzissenkreuz's teachings and has passed the Level 1 test. Though we hoped that he could spread said teachings in Inazuma, he seems to, for reasons his own, prefer living in Fontaine. He is also a romance novelist of some fame, and his work is peppered with hidden Remurian riddles. His success is intimately related to the Ordo's research.
