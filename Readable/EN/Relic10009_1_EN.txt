This silver goblet is a family heirloom of an exiled aristocrat. The exterior was once inlaid with a gem engraved with his family crest.
But after the exile had brought shame to his family, he carved out the symbol of which he was once proud.
As a result, this cup is broken and can no longer hold liquid.
But the exile still carries it with him until the end of his journey.
