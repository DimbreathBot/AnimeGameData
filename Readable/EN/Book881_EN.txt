(A green-edged slip of paper that rustles at the touch. On it is written the following...)
May only be used as a Flamegranate root system pass. Please handle with care.
Will not be reissued if lost.
If you have picked this up accidentally, please return it promptly to the guard by the entrance of the Flamegranate's roots.
The Scions of the Canopy will reward its return.
