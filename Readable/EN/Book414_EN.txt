I am Nagato. I was wounded by Amenoma Yuuya. He took my most precious blade. I chased him, but could not catch him. I lay down here to rest on account of my exhaustion. I thought that I might croak right here â€” my stomach kept on bleeding! But it seems that some strange power has sustained me...
Why did he steal that blade? I was going to sell it to him! He even burned my warehouse down!
Agh, it hurts. It hurts! But for some reason, I can't fall unconscious, so all I can do to distract from the pain is write.
What will happen to Sachiko, Yuuichi and Yuuji...
I'm sorry to them. I really am. Only now do I realize how stuck in my ways I was, and how blind to my obsession! I must have been cursed...
I collected all those strange and bizarre things, but they won me not one iota of happiness or warmth. Put all of it together, and it still wouldn't have been worth a single word from her mouth.
Thank you... and sorry for letting you down, Sachiko.
