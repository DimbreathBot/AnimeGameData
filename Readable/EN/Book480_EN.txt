(The name of the king in the opening line of this inscription was once inlaid with green gems, but a few of them have been dug out.)
In the second year of the Verdant Lord Zumurud, child of Muzaffar the Dey Malik, a dream came to the Verdant Lord, which shall be recorded faithfully here.

Zumurud saw the following in a dream last night.
He dreamed that in the darkness, the sun arose from his... swallowing the light of the stars and the moon.
The sun shone over the land that was filled with yellow sand, and not even the slightest trace of a bird could be found there.
The Verdant Lord sighed at the sight of this vision, determining that... should become like the forest, a paradise of green. As he breathed, out of the desert... vast, clear springs, and a boundless... trees that touched the very skies.
He saw a thousand ships, ten thousand roses, a hundred... caravans without number, woven into gold across the desert...
Just as... about to put on those golden robes, he awoke to see an arrow of sunlight piercing the summit of a mountain.

The Verdant Lord was raised in the forest and knows not the language of the desert, and so the greatest of scholars have been instructed to pen his dream down into prose, to be thus carved here.
