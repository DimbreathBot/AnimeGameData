{M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME} and Ms. Paimon, it's me, Blanche!\nSurprised? You didn't expect me to write so soon, right? Hehe!\nActually, it's nothing. I just found some super huge, super sweet Bulle Fruits. I've had a lot of them in my life, but ones like these are a first! As such, I wanted you to have some too.\nI hope they are still fresh when you read this letter.
