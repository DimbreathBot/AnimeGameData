They say that the one legends call the Python King, the Sacred Lord of Transgression, and the Lord of the Cinder City once used the ancient dragons' legacy to create this "city above the city."
I do not know how he did it... but the woven scrolls I've found speak of a jade heart beneath the earth, as well as hollows that connect to the surface.
This should be one of those "hollows."
If the records are correct, this place was once home to... Well, more devices, but it looks empty now.
Looks like I'll have to continue my search elsewhere.
They say that the founder of the Saurian Relics Association once came to this place. It would be nice if I could find something of value here...
