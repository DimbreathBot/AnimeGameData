—Misfortune—
Be careful. You may be about to lose something that you treasure.
Remember to rest if you're feeling unwell.
Think twice before you make a decision.

Your lucky object for the day: Frosty Mist Flower
The Mist Flower gives off a coldness that says: I am unapproachable.
But sometimes, that same cool air can calm one's heart and mind.
This may help you to judge situations correctly, and act wisely.
