1
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,400
Aah! So... so lifelike...

2
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,225
...

3
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,425
Why is nothing working!?

4
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,000
This foe is not invincible

5
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,975
You hold the treasure

6
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,525
The power to defeat it

7
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:11,125
In your own two hands

8
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,450
The treasure? You mean...!

9
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:15,950
The names!

10
00:01:16,225 --> 00:01:17,950
It's the Marechaussee Hunters' names!

11
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,175
How are we supposed to...?

12
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:21,825
You forget, Paimon?

13
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:23,000
There's still one skill

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,825
We saved until the very end!

15
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,075
Hunters fight not for fame

16
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,950
But to aid the people whenever they are summoned

17
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,100
Walter the Marechaussee Hunter

18
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,425
Master of a thousand tricks

19
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:36,475
Executioner of the Phantom Hunters

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,150
I call for aid!

21
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,550
Este the Marechaussee Hunter

22
00:01:44,025 --> 00:01:45,850
Inheritor of Cassiodor's will

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,325
Judge of the Shadow Hunters

24
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:50,875
Answer my call!

25
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,300
Petronilla

26
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,475
Protector of Justice and Order...

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,100
The Hunter I respect the most...

28
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,075
Thank you for saving my friend

29
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,900
The best one I'll ever know

30
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:08,400
Please

31
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:10,900
Lend us your strength

32
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,300
We have come

33
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,400
To answer your summons
