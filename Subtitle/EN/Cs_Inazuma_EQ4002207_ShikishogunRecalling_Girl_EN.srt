1
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:13,350
Master Kamuna

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,150
Over half our trained samurai are wounded

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,200
And our shikigami losses are far greater than anticipated

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,650
Besides

5
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:22,175
The outside situation is beginning to stabilize

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,100
Do we really need to keep pursuing this "ultimate attainment"?

7
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,200
Why so apprehensive?

8
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:31,200
This is all within my expectation

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,900
Harunosuke

10
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:34,250
Forgive my directness

11
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:36,075
But she's not coming back

12
00:00:37,925 --> 00:00:41,800
All I ever wanted... was to assist her descendants

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,950
And guard this territory

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,175
Now that our targets no longer exist

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And those needing our protection are finally safe

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,775
Then perhaps our sworn mission

17
00:00:54,775 --> 00:00:56,874
Has indeed come to an end

18
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,583
I always believed

19
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:06,350
That I would stand guard in this place forever

20
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,140
If time permitted

21
00:01:09,975 --> 00:01:11,425
I almost fooled myself

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,000
With such a notion

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,500
I hope you never make the same mistake

24
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:17,825
Don't worry

25
00:01:17,825 --> 00:01:18,650
Harunosuke

26
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,050
I know everything

27
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,725
That you've done for Inazuma

28
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,550
Your efforts need not be judged by others

29
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:28,050
The same goes for my existence

30
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:32,150
Bestowing you with intelligence

31
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,575
That should you know human emotion

32
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:36,975
It would seem this was the right decision

33
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,075
In the end

34
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:44,275
It is you that have enlightened me

35
00:01:57,425 --> 00:01:59,725
"Rosy cheeked in the morning"

36
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,075
"Bleached bones by dusk"

37
00:02:03,675 --> 00:02:05,525
How so very true

38
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,825
I have nothing left

39
00:02:07,825 --> 00:02:09,100
To keep me

40
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,450
Shiki Taishou, my friend

41
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,800
You have completed your assignment magnificently

42
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,725
As for me... I need wait no longer

43
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:22,275
I will set out again

44
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,350
In search of a new purpose

45
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,600
Then this is farewell

46
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,725
Harunosuke

47
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:33,125
Be safe in your travels

48
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:41,283
I remember everything

49
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,550
Harunosuke didn't abandon me

50
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:45,925
It was I

51
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:47,350
That persuaded him

52
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,250
And helped him escape

53
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,100
The labyrinth of his heart
