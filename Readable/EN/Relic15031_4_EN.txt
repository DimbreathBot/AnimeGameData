This emblem was specially designed and given to those who had, in the past,
Performed feats of arms in Fontaine's defense. Insignias of this sort were largely symbols of glory,
But some awardees would conceal them or consign them to the water.

"Pursue the phantoms in the dark, expel them all, and hunt them down."
Such is the origin of the name "Marechaussee Hunter,"
Credited to one Cassiodor, who would be elevated to the revered title of "Golden Hunter,"
But who saw the name as a humiliation.
Yet, heretics and demons are rare, but people who are driven to become heretics and demons are legion.
Today, the Marechaussee Phantom is more focused on investigating criminal activity than battle,
And has absorbed into its ranks a large number of Melusines, members of a young race.

This emblem once belonged to a Marechaussee Hunter who took part in and directed the Siege of Poisson.
Due to this event, he left the ranks of the Marechaussee and planned to live out the rest of his days, content with the contents of his cup.
It was not until an old friend requested that he, against his will, try living with others again,
That he tried to create a world free of dark phantoms for his son and daughter.
At the end, that which welcomed him was a peaceful ocean, one which removed all barriers and estrangements.
