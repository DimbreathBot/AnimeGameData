To My Teacher, Froderock Fronkonsteen:
...In summary, though the Tanit tribe is willing to negotiate with us and will lure a "traitor to the tribe" into a pre-arranged ambush, such that we may capture them...
...I recommend that we perform careful examinations of any experimental subjects we may obtain, just in case they try to pull some dirty tricks...
...Captain Zoya is very displeased with this deal. She notes that not only have we been constrained at every turn by that dastardly desert woman, but we have now been relegated to the role of servants helping the desert folk to clean up their internal messes, even at cost to ourselves... and such... I must say that this does indeed impugn upon our honor as Fatui...
...The above is enclosed for your reference, such that you may have the firmest grasp possible of the situation...
Vice Expedition Commander,
Lieutenant Ruslan Snezhevich

...
(Enclosed below is a table of records that shows a multi-factor physical inspection of a Tanit tribeswoman named "Jeht." It seems that the examiner evaluates her physical state rather highly.)
Most excellent! To be honest, previous experience had me worried that these desert folk might just give us some infirm wretch from their number and call it generosity. But no! This subject's health is well beyond expectations, and does indeed have a fair amount of value...
...I urge you to consider, Captain Zoya, that if we are able to complete this research work in the desert, perhaps our entire expeditionary force may receive the favor of our great Harbinger...
(This line has been crossed out using a red pen, and a line in red has been added: "How about you consider military regulations? Or perhaps you would like to consider how long you have left to live?")

...We must complete our transfer to an exfiltration point and close the deal post-haste. Wait for the arrival of the "transfer notification" to be advised on follow-up actions.
