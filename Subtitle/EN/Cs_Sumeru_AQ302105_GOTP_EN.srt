1
00:00:01,458 --> 00:00:04,150
Civilization is born of knowledge

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,525
But so, too, can knowledge be its demise

3
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:12,825
A disaster caught us unaware

4
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:16,725
It was knowledge that did not belong to this world

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,750
King Deshret brought this forbidden knowledge into our world

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,200
And it quickly spread like a plague

7
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:30,150
People's minds were filled with crazed whispers

8
00:00:30,336 --> 00:00:33,650
Dark gray scales spread across their bodies

9
00:00:33,925 --> 00:00:37,075
Even the land was stripped of its vigor

10
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:41,550
Only a desperate, deathly silence remained

11
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:46,208
Were it not for Greater Lord Rukkhadevata from the forests

12
00:00:46,528 --> 00:00:49,275
The damage would have been irreversible

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,925
She summoned the priests to build temples

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,825
And infused into them the divine power of life

15
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:01,175
The disaster was miraculously tempered

16
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:06,100
And the embers of our civilization were preserved in Aaru Village

17
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:09,725
Alas, the miracle could not last

18
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,325
As long as forbidden knowledge continued to exist

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,150
It would forever blight this world

20
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:18,150
In the end

21
00:01:18,464 --> 00:01:23,200
The proud king of the desert... my eternal lord...

22
00:01:23,325 --> 00:01:25,850
Chose to sacrifice himself

23
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,224
I have spent my whole life since guarding one of these many temples

24
00:01:32,608 --> 00:01:37,750
But now, my duty is coming to an end

25
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,025
As I close my eyes for the final time

26
00:01:42,975 --> 00:01:47,650
The sight of that noble deity will appear in my vision once more...

27
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:52,400
In helping King Deshret to eradicate forbidden knowledge

28
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,550
She exhausted her strength, and her form became that of a small child

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,325
How strange

30
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:05,050
Now that I think of her, I no longer have any fear of death...

31
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,175
For I sense that

32
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:12,150
The spirit of life will abide with me during my eternal sleep

33
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,875
Children of the desert

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,050
Cling no longer to past grievances

35
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:22,275
But hold tight to the memory

36
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,280
Of this act of benevolence
