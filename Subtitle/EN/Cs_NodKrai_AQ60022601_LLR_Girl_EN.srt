1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,707
You think I'd lie to my little sis?

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,706
What a letdown...

3
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,923
Go get it for me, Lumine

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,675
It belongs to me

5
00:00:27,175 --> 00:00:28,425
I never believed it...

6
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:30,275
I didn't want to believe it...

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,009
That strange feeling that something was off...

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,250
I wanted it to be real so badly...

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,925
Even if it only lasted a moment...

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,625
But you... You're not my brother!

11
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:53,700
Help!

12
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:56,200
O Moon Goddess... Please, save us!

13
00:00:56,425 --> 00:00:59,475
Why is this happening to us? Have we been abandoned?

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,725
The cold night should be our blessing

15
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,870
Yet only confusion and sorrow remain...

16
00:01:11,984 --> 00:01:15,022
The truth may yet lie beyond the sky...

17
00:01:15,047 --> 00:01:18,368
But must we become lost because of it?

18
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:22,528
Standing before you, as a scion of Hyperborea

19
00:01:22,528 --> 00:01:26,080
And the Frostmoon's emissary, I say this...

20
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,875
Should the false sky above dim the light of the moon...

21
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,375
...Then from silver blood that flows as rivers

22
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,900
Let us weave moonlight anew!
