—Qingyun Peak, Jueyun Karst—
I shall preface my adventurer's diary with a stern reminder to myself. Recently, I keep discovering that I've misplaced my diary every time I feel like I want to write in it. Oh, Roald, you must learn to be more careful in future!

After climbing for what feels like an eternity, I have finally reached the top of the precipice. I'm surrounded by a sea of clouds. It's impossible to know where in the midst of that sea of clouds I once stood looking up at this celestial place where the adepti dwell.

Apart from the few oddly-shaped trees, there are barely any signs of life here at the top of the precipice. Occasionally, a Lapis Glede will let out a high-pitched cry before diving down into the clouds and disappearing from view. Up the hill from here is the adeptus's dwelling, but there's a few things I need to sort out before I head up. The most pressing issue is repairing my climbing gear, I'll also tend to a few cuts and grazes while I'm at it. A kind farmer gave me some ointment when I first arrived in Jueyun Karst — it stings, but it really does work.

Nights atop the precipice offer little in the way of comfort. The relentless wind above the clouds pierces to the bone. It's difficult to shelter oneself from it, because it finds its way to you through all the tiny gaps in the tent, and there's no way you could keep a campfire alight in this wind. A good night's sleep is therefore out of the question. I wonder if the adeptus who dwells at the summit ever gets lonely and dispirited being surrounded by nothing but the cold, heartless wind?

At the end of a long and sleepless night, I finally watched the moon set into the sea of clouds. I'll make sure my pack is securely fastened, then at daybreak I'll begin my journey to the summit where the adeptus dwells. Hopefully, the altitude is high enough that it won't rain.
