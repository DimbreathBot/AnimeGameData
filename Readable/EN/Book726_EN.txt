Liam once wore bright clothes and laughed happily.
Liam once wrote songs without fear of taboos and mocked the hypocrites.
Liam will no longer sing out loud or act so proud.
But Liam will not stoop to beg.
And Liam will not bend or compromise.
Liam and his music will travel far and fly high.
And in a vast and empty land, Liam will continue to sing.

If you have heard this song, friend, will you, too, never give up?
If you share those ideals, <color=#00E1FFFF>please retrieve Liam's pride</color>,
And he shall reward you.
