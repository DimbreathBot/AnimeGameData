1
00:00:05,675 --> 00:00:06,400
My story...

2
00:00:08,393 --> 00:00:09,098
Yes

3
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:10,550
I should have known

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,309
Master's failed specimen in the dragon's belly

5
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:15,747
This

6
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:18,012
Is where the story truly begins

7
00:00:23,418 --> 00:00:24,925
If we switched places...

8
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:27,574
If you were the survivor...

9
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:30,812
Then, as the abandoned experiment

10
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:33,639
The failure of the Primordial Human Project...

11
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:36,103
I'd wanna replace you too

12
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,027
I would replicate your appearance

13
00:00:39,716 --> 00:00:40,906
Study your alchemy

14
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:43,267
And create miraculous lifeforms

15
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:45,031
To divert your attention

16
00:00:50,504 --> 00:00:51,440
I would wait for the right moment

17
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:53,463
Then dispose of you and the Traveler

18
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:55,862
The sole person to have known your secret

19
00:00:58,471 --> 00:00:59,516
And then...

20
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:01,159
I could finally experience the joy

21
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:03,557
Of being brought into the world
