1
00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:08,969
...Maybe no single nation is her home

2
00:00:11,072 --> 00:00:13,760
...Where exactly is "home" to you?

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,144
...Searching your memories?

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,328
The curse is still active

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,347
This will only hasten your demise

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,842
...We're all from Nod-Krai

7
00:00:29,632 --> 00:00:30,912
...Cross the ocean

8
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:33,349
Find a new place to belong

9
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:40,064
What an amazing machine...

10
00:00:40,768 --> 00:00:41,984
Where are you from?

11
00:00:43,904 --> 00:00:45,120
Such a hard worker!

12
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,360
Fancy making this your new home?

13
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:52,050
...It's the Wild Hunt!

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:52,800
Look out!

15
00:01:03,325 --> 00:01:04,192
Impossible...

16
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,879
Where is this data from?

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,091
...From now on, your name's "Ineffa"!

18
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,425
Promise me...

19
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,725
Remember

20
00:01:20,084 --> 00:01:22,032
You have to come home!

21
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:28,512
Re...

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,796
Return...

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,928
Data... overload...

24
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,552
Capacity... exceeded...

25
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:47,328
As long as this gem's around

26
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,631
The "heart" that Ixquieh built you

27
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:51,370
Should keep beating away

28
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:57,019
It may take centuries, even millennia

29
00:01:57,577 --> 00:02:03,567
But one day, may your new memories transcend your pain and rage...

30
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:06,588
To conquer the curse that shackles you

31
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,486
What kind of gem is it?

32
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,353
Nothing special, really

33
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:18,900
To quote my mother... it's nothing but an empty shell now

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,600
But if you break free of the curse

35
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,925
Then maybe...

36
00:02:24,575 --> 00:02:25,275
Hmm...?

37
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,904
Hehe, nothing

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,950
An interesting idea suddenly occurred to me...

39
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,450
Hmm... Let's make this the final secret key

40
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:43,584
The final secret key... is...

41
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:55,923
Impossible...
