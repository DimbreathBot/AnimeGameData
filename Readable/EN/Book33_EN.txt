On the surface, the six pygmies were true to the Princess and Prince, and followed them everywhere. But they were still heinous creatures from the Land of Night, and corruption flowed in their veins. As the days traveling to the Kingdom of Light grew long and dangerous, the root of evil would again blossom in their hearts.
Fear gave root to malice, and out of malice grew evil scheming. The six pygmies started to devise their nasty plot.
The blind pygmy opened his sightless eyes and enjoyed the sunlight greedily.
"Why not keep the Prince with us forever? Instead of believing in unfathomable promises, securing the sunlight before us is our best bet."
The foolish pygmy gently patted his scabies-ridden head and gulped the light-filled air rapaciously.
"Hehehe, I... I think we should kidnap the Prince and use... use him to make us smarter. That's the smart way!"
The timid pygmy swung his tiny fists in the air and yelled.
"All that rascal did was save our lives and now he acts so condescendingly, treating us like servants. I shall challenge him to a duel!"
The shrunken pygmy squinted in disdain. His complexion wrinkled up like a piece of crumpled paper.
"Brothers, you have been hiding in the shadows for too long. The darkness has clouded your judgment. It is new life that we need in order to survive. I say we use the corpse of the Prince as fertilizer so my garden might flourish again."
The carefree pygmy sighed and looked sullen.
"We'd better get this over with quickly... If it weren't for them, these evil thoughts wouldn't have entered my mind, and I wouldn't have become so somber."
There was one pygmy who did not join the discussion. This is not because he was not evil, but because the guilt of betraying his savior overcame his wicked nature enough to make him keep his mouth shut. He couldn't even say a single word. Nevertheless, the guilt could not completely suppress his corrupt nature and the pygmies all agreed to the scheme. They decided to poison the Prince's water.
