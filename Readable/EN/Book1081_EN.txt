My dear Captain Radius, today is your lucky day.
Word from Nasha Town: Some bigwigs have gotten it in their heads that they want a glimpse of those funky Monetoo from Tenochtzitoc. If you and your crew prove willing in capture one, we might reconsider our claims on spine ownership... along with some of your other pesky personal debts.
I'm sure you won't turn down such a generous offer.
Of course, I've already sent Icahua ahead to the resort as insurance. He'll be watching your every move until your triumphant return.
Yours sincerely, Black Reef Rekis.
(...At the end of the letter is a line of angry writing...)
