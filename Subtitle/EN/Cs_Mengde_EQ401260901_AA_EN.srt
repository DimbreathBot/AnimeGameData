1
00:00:08,198 --> 00:00:10,758
Far from my native land I roamed

2
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,600
In streams I slept

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,269
Many seasons I met as the suns set and rose

4
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:21,760
I searched for a garden to call a home

5
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:25,166
And the moonlight ebbed as the water flowed

6
00:00:29,474 --> 00:00:32,910
A soft breeze beckoned me unto a spring

7
00:00:33,428 --> 00:00:37,268
"Sleep, weary wanderer, your journey is over"

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,620
"May the dancing petals sweeten your slumber"

9
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:46,325
At dawn I hummed the melody of a distant stream

10
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,934
And the songs in the night serenaded my dreams

11
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:57,524
A boy's tender tears trembled through the water

12
00:00:58,548 --> 00:01:01,940
Stirring me more than any starlight sonata

13
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,060
He wove me a wreath from past petals and future buds

14
00:01:07,656 --> 00:01:12,500
I crossed beyond the veil of dreams to the realm of flesh and blood

15
00:01:13,811 --> 00:01:16,916
"Look at the love that shines from his eager gaze"

16
00:01:17,217 --> 00:01:21,012
"Answer the call of his heart, lest this moment go to waste"

17
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:24,996
The kittens and fireflies invited my heartstrings to sing

18
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,370
But I was a stranger to the melody of mankind

19
00:01:28,525 --> 00:01:31,268
And knew not how this tune should begin

20
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,004
As the river of dreams trickled into the ocean blue

21
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:39,210
Every time a crystalfly flapped its wings

22
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,124
Older it seemed he grew

23
00:01:42,532 --> 00:01:46,756
But I learned to fathom human ways each stumbling step I took

24
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,452
And clouds of confusion became crystal clear in the vulnerable verse I wrote

25
00:01:54,436 --> 00:01:58,084
As seed yearns for soil, and trees for the sun

26
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,732
A once-foreign melody inside my heart sung

27
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:06,276
And it cried out your name on every string it could strum

28
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:11,092
Now, I give my dream to you

29
00:02:12,017 --> 00:02:16,900
May it be in your slumber a sweet spring to quench your thirst

30
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:23,066
Now, I hand my heart to you

31
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:27,272
Praying my belated promise might meet

32
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,084
Still with your trust
