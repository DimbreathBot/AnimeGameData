00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:03,800
Congratulations, guide from the future

2
00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:07,575
You've completed a challenge that even I found ambitious

3
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:11,851
And now, I finally have the chance to tell you my story

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,310
You may have heard legends describing me

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,225
As the best guide in all of Natlan

6
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:22,875
But in the beginning, I was more like a treasure hunter

7
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,750
I chased results

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,900
Facing countless dangers to prove myself

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,550
Time after time, I ventured where others didn't dare

10
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:35,175
Never failing to bring back rare treasures

11
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:38,390
My fame was second to none

12
00:00:40,054 --> 00:00:42,358
And yet, I never felt satisfied

13
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,500
So I found a new goal...

14
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,500
A challenge that no one had ever achieved before...

15
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:53,200
The legendary mysterious island. Another chance to prove myself

16
00:00:54,518 --> 00:00:58,225
Unfortunately, my friends, who had traveled with me all this time

17
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,022
Had grown tired of my nonsense

18
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,225
Instead of praise, they now showered me with words of caution

19
00:01:06,102 --> 00:01:10,650
Perhaps... this journey was one that I had to complete alone

20
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:12,575
But luckily...

21
00:01:12,925 --> 00:01:15,650
They decided to once again put up with my antics

22
00:01:16,918 --> 00:01:18,070
Just as before

23
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:21,925
They came up with ingenious ways to help me move forward

24
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:24,950
They never let me down

25
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:28,150
Even when I had to place my life in their hands

26
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,156
And they always trusted my judgment

27
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,325
Even when it took a lot of courage

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,350
In the end, just as ever

29
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:39,550
We found the "result" we came for

30
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,582
But...

31
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,674
That golden glow was baiting me towards death

32
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:49,150
It was the glow of a rare ore

33
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,075
But it was also a warning sign of an impending eruption

34
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,900
Maybe if I pressed on, and put my life on the line

35
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,725
I could get the result I wanted

36
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:00,043
And yet...

37
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,025
There was a chance I'd lose something even more precious

38
00:02:05,785 --> 00:02:06,937
But don't worry

39
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,250
In the end... I made the same choice as you

40
00:02:10,725 --> 00:02:12,133
Everyone was disappointed

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,750
That the illustrious guide had, for once, returned empty-handed

42
00:02:18,475 --> 00:02:20,907
But seeing everyone survive

43
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:25,500
I felt satisfied for the first time in my life

44
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:30,025
Perhaps the treasure I'd really been searching for

45
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,875
Had been right here with me all along

46
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:36,875
So, I decided to end my long journey

47
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:40,500
And find a safe place for my hard-earned treasure

48
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:48,217
To me, this is the real mysterious island
