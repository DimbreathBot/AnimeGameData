1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:05,514
In the end, the people will all be dissolved into the waters

2
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:08,157
And only Furina will remain

3
00:00:08,706 --> 00:00:10,364
Weeping on her throne...

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,497
Only then

5
00:00:21,986 --> 00:00:26,219
Will the sins of the people of Fontaine be washed away

6
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:52,671
Hey! Help! Over here!

7
00:01:30,316 --> 00:01:32,428
All hands, initiate emergency rescue!

8
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:42,815
Hurry!

9
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,076
Hey, lend a hand!

10
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:23,207
Look! The water's receding!

11
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:39,298
We didn't dissolve

12
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:42,395
The prophecy was wrong! The prophecy was wrong!

13
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:07,672
The prophecy...

14
00:03:08,657 --> 00:03:09,621
Was wrong?
