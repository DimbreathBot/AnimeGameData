(A manual that seems to have seen a lot of use, judging by the proliferation of handwritten notes scrawled upon its pages.)
...
Regarding the Emergency Brake System:
The mining facility's brake system is a safety mechanism that must be manually activated and is designed to shut down the core and prevent mechanical damage resulting from malfunctions of the phlogiston research machinery.
When a potentially dangerous malfunction is detected, please activate the control consoles on both sides to initiate braking measures.

(Handwritten notes below...)
— Are these things they shipped us really all that useful? Is modifying it to power it all with lava from Natlan even feasible...?
— Alright, Vasily, no point flipping through this manual any longer. Just keep your eye on these machines, humming and whirring away...

(Below this section is written...)
— Fine, as requested by Vasily, I hereby declare the following: I promise not to accidentally lock myself in the cage again, nor will I attempt to smash open the lock, thereby necessitating the activation of the braking system... On top of this, I solemnly swear that I will thoroughly read through this manual, cross my heart and hope to die. That's gotta be good enough, yeah?
— You'd better make good on that, Sidorenko. Seriously, if I have to catch those crazy little critters and put them all back in the cage one more time...
