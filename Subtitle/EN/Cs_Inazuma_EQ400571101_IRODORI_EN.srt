1
00:00:01,344 --> 00:00:04,992
Long ago, Inazuma had five legendary poets

2
00:00:05,312 --> 00:00:08,768
People bestowed upon them the title of The Five Kasen

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,368
One Year

4
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:13,550
The poet Suikou made his way to Tenshukaku

5
00:00:13,632 --> 00:00:16,725
And presented the Kasen's work for the Shogun's perusal

6
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:20,864
But a page from the works of Aoi no Okina had been torn out

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,125
And Suikou was questioned regarding the matter

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,175
Suikou pleaded guilty

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,675
He admitted to drinking at the tavern the night before

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,000
And vaguely recalled a mysterious figure approaching while he was intoxicated

11
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:42,625
That figure was none other than Aoi no Okina himself

12
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:46,025
This turn of events had begun with an unnamed individual

13
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:49,200
Under whose coercion Aoi no Okina was forced

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,025
To take drastic measures to retrieve a page of poetry

15
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,400
He knew nothing

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,825
Of this individual's true intentions 

17
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,375
All he knew was that

18
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,725
The poem had to do with an old acquaintance, Akahito

19
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,075
Akahito had once belonged to the Five Kasen

20
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,250
Each poem he composed, he marked with a scarlet red seal

21
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:13,125
Hence the "Aka" in his name

22
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,625
Such a distinguished writer was he

23
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,800
And yet one of the poems he had submitted the previous year

24
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:20,925
Was found to be plagiarized

25
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:24,050
Akahito was exiled for his crimes

26
00:01:24,175 --> 00:01:27,600
And only four of the Five Kasen remained

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,025
Sumizome went over Akahito's poems

28
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,525
And noticed that the plagiarized poem lacked his seal

29
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,250
She immersed his poetry in a stream nearby

30
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,500
And only on the plagiarized poem

31
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:44,525
Did the ink run

32
00:01:45,152 --> 00:01:47,264
Aoi no Okina passed by

33
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,050
And witnessed Sumizome's doing

34
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,975
Which he then recorded in a poem

35
00:01:53,975 --> 00:01:58,025
Thus transpired the events of Suikou's poetry submission

36
00:01:58,425 --> 00:02:01,465
And this is where the story comes to an end
