1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,775
Most benevolent among all adepti are the Qilin

2
00:00:04,775 --> 00:00:09,800
They drink only spring water and eat only whole grain

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,725
But perhaps the mountainous dwellings of adepti in Jueyun Karst

4
00:00:14,725 --> 00:00:17,930
Might be too lonely for her human side

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,150
Under moonlight did one see her last

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,675
She stood by the precipice's edge

7
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:27,275
And upon the mist-veiled mountains she gazed

8
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:29,150
Her thin figure was immersed

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,075
In the vast sea of clouds

10
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:34,125
One noticed her loneliness

11
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:37,975
And sought to convince her to go back to the human world

12
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:39,725
But

13
00:00:39,725 --> 00:00:41,275
Just then

14
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:44,016
She said thus:

15
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,075
"Liyue Harbor feels"

16
00:00:46,075 --> 00:00:48,800
"Even lonelier than Jueyun Karst"

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,125
"When I look at the sea of clouds in Jueyun Karst"

18
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:56,350
"I merely feel the loneliness of a solitary cloud gazer"

19
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,100
"When I step into the sea of people in Liyue"

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,425
"I feel the loneliness of an inhuman"

21
00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:04,250
"That doesn't belong in the human world"
