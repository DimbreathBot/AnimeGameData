The maiden's flower. Fresh and elegant just like its original owner.
The books say that this species of flower has long been extinct.

Just like that passage the maiden had read countless times in books:
"The damsel in distress was saved by the white knight in shining armor."
"And they exchanged flowers as blessings to one another."

Though a maiden's heart is said to change with the seasons, just like a flower,
This flower remained constant.
For her heart had stopped in that moment long ago:
The moment that she met the knight.
