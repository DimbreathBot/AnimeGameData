1
00:00:00,576 --> 00:00:02,752
People say all kids do is cry

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,250
But when I think of you

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,598
My sweet child

4
00:00:07,744 --> 00:00:09,408
All I remember is your smile

5
00:00:10,816 --> 00:00:13,525
Watching the saurians ride the Spiritways

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,375
 Or the feather from Uncle Chaco's hat dance in the wind

7
00:00:18,273 --> 00:00:21,402
One night, as you smiled up at the stars

8
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:24,704
Your dad got lost in the sight as well

9
00:00:25,372 --> 00:00:29,376
Were you drawn in by some greater meaning, I wondered

10
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:35,125
But, no. The stars were just smiling back

11
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,904
Aroni, stop writing, and join us!

12
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,726
Team Leader, give us a toast!

13
00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:44,608
Okay, then...

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,792
May our homeland prosper, our friendship endure

15
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:52,664
And may this be a journey we never forget!

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,450
Shh! He's laughing!

17
00:00:56,975 --> 00:01:00,032
I heard, babies that smile a lot are blessed with luck...

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,000
That's just superstition...

19
00:01:03,424 --> 00:01:04,475
It's true!

20
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,402
None of us know the reason

21
00:01:06,402 --> 00:01:08,566
Behind all those smiles...

22
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:15,081
But I think, you can sense all the love around you

23
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,375
Can't you?

24
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,895
We love you so much

25
00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:22,619
May you always be my happy boy

26
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,632
Where did these Abyssal monsters come from?

27
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:26,528
Run!

28
00:01:27,225 --> 00:01:29,100
No good, exits are blocked!

29
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:30,616
Aroni, the babyâ€”

30
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:32,322
Aroni!

31
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:38,112
My child...

32
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:41,675
Stay with me! I'm here! I'll protect you!

33
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:45,175
Leave me... Just keep him... safe...

34
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:04,134
Gods, if you can hear my prayer...

35
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:10,314
Take my body, my love, and my memories as fuel

36
00:02:11,325 --> 00:02:13,875
Even if my soul is barred from the Night Kingdom

37
00:02:14,497 --> 00:02:16,425
Doomed to wander the desolate wilds...

38
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:19,662
I offer up all that I am...

39
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,714
...That this child might live

40
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:40,028
I have no doubt, you'll meet many good friends one day

41
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,944
Because I know

42
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,574
You're the luckiest child there is

43
00:02:47,717 --> 00:02:49,367
Smile for me, my darling...

44
00:02:50,176 --> 00:02:53,760
Let Mommy see it... one last time
