00:00:00,384 --> 00:00:05,150
When I woke up, I was riding in a flower carriage

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,375
It was... It was my birthday

3
00:00:11,584 --> 00:00:15,325
The Knight of Flowers and their attendants found me

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,120
"Archon, we finally found you. The people can't wait to meet you"

5
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:28,544
As the Sabzeruz Festival began, everyone smiled and gathered around me...

6
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,225
Are those... Padisarahs?

7
00:00:43,212 --> 00:00:47,308
Everyone prepared a bunch of surprises for me

8
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:55,100
Candy exploded in all directions, like dazzling fireworks

9
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,655
Ready! Three, two, one...!

10
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:10,825
A bird suddenly appeared

11
00:01:11,499 --> 00:01:14,699
And in that moment, the world erupted in brilliant color

12
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:21,143
Actually... I have a surprise of my own

13
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:23,063
Come on out!

14
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:12,261
When I woke up, I was riding in a flower carriage

15
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:15,600
It felt just like a dream

16
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:20,389
Never had I witnessed a more perfect day
