00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:07,800
You, too, have the potential to be driven mad by knowledge

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,750
But the truths you seek are so insipid...

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,606
How laughable that you should die for their sake!

4
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:27,675
You're wrong

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,400
The unknown is but a fog to be dispersed

6
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,300
Knowledge... is the true pillar of the world

7
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,275
You're not the only one who got stronger

8
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,650
Pulonia!

9
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,141
No, wait!

10
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:18,227
This isn't oveâ€”!
