At first, all was still, apart from the curtains in the breeze,
And the faint sounds of animals chewing, echoing through the walls from some unknown place.
Then, an odd rasping laugh erupted from an empty room,
A nameless horror spreading in the dark.
Then, with terrible thunder and storm,
A glowing red fog-cloud,
Embraced the castle just like a shroud.
On the castle's great central stage, a tall thin figure did appear,
A dark spirit in black robes, arriving at last.
The guests, a moment ago enjoying their revels,
Fell to the floor one by one,
Bereft of time even to scream.
The master sat shivering and still on his throne,
His soul also snatched by the dark.
Amid the roar of brick and tile hitting the ground,
The castle's glory faded into the past,
Swallowed by glimmering waves.
The blood moon the towers once blocked reappeared in the sky,
Its baleful glow sweeping the land.
And today, by the banks of the world's purest lake,
The water reflects the long-fallen, faded castle.
The joy and brilliance that once lit its halls,
Consigned to legends and dreams.
The ruins lie suffocated in the gloom.
Through shattered windows, statues appear as like to monsters,
Who with the discordant tune that played sank with the castle into the sea.
There is nothing there now, bar darkness, death, and loss.
