Dear Miss Aila,
I am truly sorry that I was unable to stop Miss Alia in that moment. Yet, it was through her noble sacrifice that we ultimately thwarted Rotwang and prevented the loss of countless lives. Now, I finally understand why she pretended to be my close companion. I hope to speak with you about this in greater detail when next we meet — though perhaps, by then, you will already know more about all this than I.
I shall not presume to judge, nor shall I attempt to alter your opinion of her. But I ask, if nothing else, that you allow me to honor Miss Alia's final wishes by sharing her words with you. She asked that I render all possible support to you (which I surely will. You are my benefactor, after all), and that — I relay this only as she spoke it — she hoped that you would go on to live a life of happiness and freedom.
As for the Arrow of Terpikeraunas you mentioned in your last letter, if it truly holds the power to dispel the pitch-black calamity, and if you are willing to share it with such selflessness, then on behalf of the people of Nod-Krai, please accept my deepest gratitude. Should, as you foresee, Rotwang indeed rise again from the pitch-black filth, then our successors — an order I am considering naming the "Lightkeepers," in honor of the flame you have kindled — will stand ready to vanquish the threat once more, armed with the technology you have so generously gifted us.
We can speak of the details in person whenever you are free. I understand all too well that, after Lovia's passing, the Frostmoon Scions have been left with countless matters demanding your attention.
Yours sincerely,
Solovei
