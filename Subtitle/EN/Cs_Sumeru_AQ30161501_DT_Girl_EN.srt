1
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,075
What are all these people doing here

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,075
At this hour of the night?

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,825
Ah, the triumphant hero returns at last

4
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:33,225
And to a rather spectacular welcome, even if I do say so myself

5
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:34,200
You're...

6
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,000
The outcast, expelled from the Akademiya...

7
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:41,350
Indeed, I am, although these days they tend to call me:

8
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,625
The Doctor

9
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,900
If you're looking for your researcher friend, she has already been taken into confinement

10
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:57,325
With some basic caution, she could have discovered the listening device on her person

11
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,550
Clearly, she lacks the degree of rigor expected of a true scholar

12
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,575
The people of Sumeru City...

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,400
What have you done to them?

14
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:17,575
I simply made some minor adjustments to their Akasha Terminals

15
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,775
Now they can deposit information directly into the subconscious

16
00:01:22,225 --> 00:01:25,625
As you can see, all these lovely people now believe

17
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:30,025
This Traveler is a hero who has just saved the world

18
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,125
Hehe... My experiment is a success

19
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:41,100
And now, it seems they can no longer hold back their sheer adoration

20
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:42,250
Oh no

21
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,700
What should we do!? These are all just regular people...

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,150
Leave now

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,975
You need to get out of here

24
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:50,600
But...

25
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:54,350
That guy's a Fatui Harbinger! We can't just leave you here...

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,725
Nor can I abandon... the people of Sumeru!

27
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,350
Don't worry

28
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,275
We'll meet again outside of the city

29
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,900
I see... You appear to have overridden their mental faculties

30
00:02:26,975 --> 00:02:29,000
With your own consciousness

31
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,525
To possess such a powerful mind...

32
00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:34,575
You must be...

33
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,125
The God of Wisdom
