1
00:00:01,125 --> 00:00:04,200
We all nestle under the great tree of wisdom

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,650
Peering out to perceive the world

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,400
From the earth

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,600
And from the rain

5
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:13,100
We perceive its wonders until we become a white bird

6
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:14,750
To perch atop a branch...

7
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:19,425
And finally snap off the most important leaf

8
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:23,700
Once upon a time

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,550
I alone dreamed in this world

10
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:28,975
In my dreams

11
00:00:29,075 --> 00:00:32,400
Everybody would also dream after they fell asleep

12
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:37,950
Wild and wonderful thoughts would emerge from their minds

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,719
Some tumbled to the ground

14
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:42,091
And others floated to the sky

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,750
Connecting all things in the world

16
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,600
Into one dazzling net

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,075
Among a plethora of worlds

18
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,950
Were numerous smaller worlds

19
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:54,600
All of fate

20
00:00:55,025 --> 00:00:58,100
Finding within the tapestry their brilliant glow

21
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,000
I gradually understood

22
00:01:02,373 --> 00:01:04,125
That these indescribable

23
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:06,200
And constantly changing things

24
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,350
Are the most profound things in the world

25
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,936
Only they

26
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,875
Can completely repel the madness

27
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:15,800
Only dreams

28
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,650
Can awaken consciousness

29
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,700
From the deepest darkness

30
00:01:39,368 --> 00:01:41,950
I'm the one who posed this question

31
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,775
Yet also the one who sought a solution

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,775
Saving the world with the dreams of the people

33
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,475
Used to be my answer

34
00:01:50,175 --> 00:01:51,350
And now

35
00:01:51,475 --> 00:01:53,700
You've also found your own answer

36
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,450
And I shall return all the dreams

37
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,475
To the people

38
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:13,100
Goodbye

39
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,950
People of Sumeru

40
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,767
May you be blessed tonight

41
00:02:17,975 --> 00:02:19,825
With the sweetest of dreams
