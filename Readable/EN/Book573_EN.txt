It feels strange to insert a letter into the mailbox that I made myself, but I did find my answer.

At first, I thought that a flower created using alchemy would constitute one "that is not of this world" according to the prophecy. But after giving it some more thought, I realized that instead of creating an actual plant, a flower-shaped mechanism made of alchemical products might fit the description better.

So I arrived at my conclusion â€” a clock in the shape of a flower.

The long passage of life brushes past the timepiece, leaving fluttering petals in its wake. The elapsing years stir up the leaves, pushing the needle of time forward.
