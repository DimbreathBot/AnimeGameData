1
00:00:16,525 --> 00:00:20,175
Red shall three bloodlines in the Bishui flow

2
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:24,712
The bones of eight heroes don frost and snow

3
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:29,433
Moon-graced by skiff my hook-blade I claim

4
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,899
As a pillar in the waters let it remain

5
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,579
The clashing blades like seafoam pass

6
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,579
Each one their end fate will decide

7
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,090
But you, Tao Dou, shall be cast down

8
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,090
Your body and soul shall not abide

9
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:45,707
Cavalry gold and iron march

10
00:00:45,707 --> 00:00:47,707
Hearts stone-set on heaven's arch

11
00:00:47,707 --> 00:00:49,707
Down starward street their mortal stride

12
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:51,707
And onward into myth they ride

13
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:56,850
For death stains not the virtues pure

14
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,962
And eastward flow vicissitudes sure

15
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:08,250
Names shall fade, hope's flame endures

16
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:13,575
Secret of the flame, blessing of Homa...

17
00:01:13,975 --> 00:01:17,100
Redeem us, deliver us from evil

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,250
Hyah!

19
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,665
The fire's almost out...

20
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,625
Did we fail?

21
00:01:41,338 --> 00:01:42,775
I have faith in the director

22
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,525
So

23
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,900
My time has come

24
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:55,325
There is no avoiding death

25
00:01:55,675 --> 00:01:57,350
Nor predicting its time

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,975
The duty of Wangsheng

27
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:02,225
I now fulfill

28
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:08,575
Look!

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,200
Next Lantern Rite...

30
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,075
If you see a butterfly

31
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:45,900
That's me coming back to see you all
