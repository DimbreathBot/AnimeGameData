Unlike the barbarians or the witless creatures of the waters,
All our strength comes from our will.
Our will is that which we share with the noblest gods,
Just as flesh is what we have in common with the barbarous beasts.
Those who can truly use this wisdom,
May be able to forsake the bonds of flesh,
And when they use their will to command, the rest shall bow down and listen.
