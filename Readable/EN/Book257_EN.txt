...
...An outlander with a chatty little fairy arrived on the island. They really came at a bad time...
...
...Thanks to that outlander's help, my research has been fast-tracked. I never would've believed that things would go so smoothly...
...Next, I will travel to the southern shoals of Yashiori Island to test the effects of the medicine once more. This time, I will be using the full dose...
...Whatever happens, I want to thank everyone for their help...
