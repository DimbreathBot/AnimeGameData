By the banks of the world's purest lake,
There once stood a glistening castle.
Gold leaf and gems decorated its walls,
And it shone blinding in the post-noon sun.
Pretty banners and flags flew from the roof,
While majestic towers soared alongside.
Guests from afar peered through colorful windows,
And marveled at the wonders every step revealed.
Yet none was more marvelous than the many statues,
Odd in form but as real as life.
In the center of the hall sat a golden stage,
Where musicians played day and night for the castle's master.
As the music sounded, listeners flocked like swarming bees,
To dance in time with the beat that seemed to captivate the entire world.
The wine flowed never-ending to sate the thirst for revelry.
All could partake, no matter their class or their homeland,
But none of this could ease the master's fears,
Or bring his troubled soul a moment of peace.
And each time the tower's clock struck its deep midnight chime,
He would be possessed by an uncontrollable panic,
Trapped by his fears and his gloom.
The dark-robed figure would surely collect on debts owed,
And all before his eyes would be turned into dust,
The souls of his guests, and his own, included,
As tribute to that dark, ancient world.
