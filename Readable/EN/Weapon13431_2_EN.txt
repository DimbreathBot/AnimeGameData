Just as the spring waters have never taken a fixed form, so too do the hearts of humans and fairies sway with the night breeze.
Only when the young man was on the verge of being consumed by the dragonlord's flames did she realize that her objective had long since become muddled.
All she had to do was abandon the one with blind faith in justice here; after all, she had already advised him to abandon his village.
Then, she had simply to find another who could become King; after all, his ideals had never concerned her anyway.

But if that was the case, then why did she now face the dragon's fire for his folly, beheld by his astonished eyes?
Perhaps this was the "communication and understanding" that the Mistress of Many Waters sought after, thought the water sprite to herself,
As she gave him one last smile, covering the sunlike blaze, leaving only rainbow hues in the rising vapor.

...

The ancient scrolls of the Meztli tell a completely different story, howeverâ€”
Under the gentle moonlight, the hero Uenuku met the wandering water sprite and fell in love.
Yet, in a moment of suspicion, he was separated from his beloved, whose name was Hineila (or Ianeira).
"They say that the human heart is as capricious as the tides. Yet how easy it is to conquer the tides; how difficult the human heart."
Filled with regret, the hero Uenuku wandered every inch of the scorched lands, searching only for his beloved.
After decades of relentless pursuit, the water sprite's hardened heart softened, finally showing a trace of compassion.
She plucked a soft cloud from the sky and turned it into a rainbow, guiding the hero towards the sea's other side.
Blessed by the Sacred Flame, Uenuku and his lover were finally reunited, never to be separated again.
The tribal elders believe that the shells we see today are fragments of the rainbow that fell into the sea back then,
And that the reason they are always formed with two connected sides is because they symbolize our wish for reunion.
