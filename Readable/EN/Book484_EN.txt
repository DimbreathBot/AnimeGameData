(This inscription has been made with very deep cuts, as if made using very rudimentary tools. The author seems to have had a very good education, but the awkwardness apparent throughout the writing tells of this person's difficult living conditions.)
The furthest east and the furthest west are too far from one another, that there should be several thousand and several hundred fools between the two poles to claim kingship.
The furthest west and the furthest east are too close to one another, and yet not even one wise person might rule it all.

None now know how much time has passed since Gurabad's great Spirit of Victory was slain, and now naught but blood and tears weave the lines of kings.
The cemeteries of sand were once high walls built by the king's uncles on either side, and more barren still are the lands where trees were forcibly planted.
My king is in exile, hidden in the rainforest realm, and I know not where he dwells — the gods' favor and gaze are now forgotten things of the past.

The blind heir worn down by agonies swears this here; the pitiable father, who was blinded by one king, and who took in another after, makes this vow:

Never again to make oaths of fealty to one mortal — and may all those who call themselves kings be like their ancestors! May they go down into the dust, buried beneath the sands!

We desert folk shall leave the ruins and palaces we have grown used to living in. We shall make a new home for ourselves at the edge of this land.
That place we shall name Aaru, after the ancient dream of the gods, and there we shall quietly wait for Al-Ahmar's revival.
