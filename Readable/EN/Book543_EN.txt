To my best friends, {NICKNAME} and Lil' Paimon:
It's been a while! Hope you still remember me. How are things going for you?
I've heard from merchants traveling from afar and some adventurers that you've returned to Sumeru, so I wrote you this letter!
I'm staying at the Tanit camp right now. Thanks to you, life's pretty good!
Well, let's make the long story short.
I've wanted to see you two again ever since we last parted, and, y'know, show you some proper hospitality... And also, there's something left over from our previous adventure that I'd like you to come help me finish.
This is something I can only trust the two of you with.
As for the specifics, I can only tell you about it once you get here!
Well, I'll see you then. I've dropped Katheryne a line, too, so don't you forget to come see me!
