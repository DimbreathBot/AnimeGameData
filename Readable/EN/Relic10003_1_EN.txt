An exceedingly ordinary old wine canteen.
If one had to point out something special about it,
It would be that it never once contained a drop of alcohol.

The guardian's longtime friend and superior joked.
"Quit knitting those eyebrows together, have a little wine and song!"
"I mean, that's how we have the courage to face tomorrow."
