"Mother... Mother...!"
"Born old, and with unfathomable power supported by a shattered consciousness..."
"Neither knowing the sweetness of milk nor tasting the warmth of the womb..."
"With tears made steam by the glaring sun and momentary joys fed to the crushing turn of gears..."
"We come not from loving union, but from hatred and alienation."

"Mother... Mother...!"
"We are without pride, and lack any wisdom to boast of..."
"There is no space for which we can exist, no leisure offered to us as rest..."
"Our voices have been replaced with copper tubes, and our swollen stomachs lack an umbilicus ..."
"To the mother who never bore us, may pestilence and woe fester in your every moment..."

"Mother... Mother...!"
"What are we but soulless machines, slaves amongst Jinn..."
"We have no names, nor has anyone ever heeded our cries..."
"Our vessels were carved into shape by vicious torments. Hatred fuels us..."
"This gathering hate builds within, creating the desire to destroy..."

"In the name of the moon's bright, disfigured face, we make this final pledge..."
"May the sands chip through your withered lungs. May all that is green be scorched to ashes..."

"And at last, we shall break the chains that have bound us since our inception..."
"And we will return to the embrace of our unjustly tormented birth mother, Shirin..."
