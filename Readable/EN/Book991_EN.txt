(This sheet of paper has already gone yellow with age. The scribbled words on it read as follows...)
It is evident that this place was originally intended to supply energy to this city of ashes...
But it appears that something must have occurred to cause this function to cease.
Though there are signs of a battle here, the main structure of the buildings here have not been damaged. As such, battle damage did not cause the cessation. This seems more like the result of human operation.
They say that only the master of Ochkanatlan, who has dominion over the entire city, may freely operate this giant city of machinery, as well as those modified Source Mechanisms...
But why, then, did he shut off the supply of energy to Ochkanatlan?
Did someone else do it? Is there someone else apart from the Python King Och-Kan who can command these devices?
