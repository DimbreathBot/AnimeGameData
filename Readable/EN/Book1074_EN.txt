Aj Awaj K'umilal Kan stormed into my laboratory in a fit of rage. He interrogated me, demanding to know if I had taught the humans how to use phlogiston. I assuaged his fury with Quenepa Berries and asked what had happened.

According to his account, it seems that a human colony near Q'umqaraq'aj has mastered the power of phlogiston and begun to expand. In the last three months, they've razed over (...) villages, sacrificed roughly (...) human victims, and clogged the River Tz'alam's very flow with discarded (...). Their leader claims to be the "Successor of Chaac," swearing to end the age of dragons and to unite the people of Natlantea under a single banner. Ix Roq'ratik'obala' Ka'alahun quelled the uprising in two days. The would-be conqueror was drowned in his own bath by his most favored consort, a captive turned killer. Leaderless, the tribe collapsed into internecine strife. Yet the secrets of phlogiston had already spread, now utterly beyond containment.

"Hmph... If you, milord, with your tender heart, have not sanctioned this folly, then the only one mad enough to dare would be..."

Awaj did not finish his sentence, muttering under his breath as he left. Truth be told, he likely concerns himself little about humans mastering phlogiston. His fury stems solely from the crudeness of their methods, a blasphemy against his life's work.

But I care. I cannot comprehend why Kukulkan (for it must be him, after all, no other would do such a foolish thing) would hand phlogiston over to the humans. I can understand his antipathy for these tiny lifeforms, brought by the usurper from beyond the sky, but I cannot comprehend his use of this method to lure them into destroying themselves. It is like handing a rusty knife to a wailing infant â€” all too vicious, and all too cruel. What outcome could he possibly expect, save for suffering and death?

...

I met with Kukulkan in private and asked him about his intentions.

As usual, he remained enigmatic and aloof. He coldly denied all accusations. He claimed that I was not truly concerned about how this matter harmed the interests of dragonkind, and that an opportunistic attempt to grab power drove my belief in such absurd slander. So infuriated was I that I burst into laughter. After refuting his accusations with a few choice words, and without even finishing my Quenepa Berries, I departed.

He is always like this. He scorns his kin, mocks his bloodline, and never shares his thoughts with other dragons, yet he resents them for failing to understand him. But if he refuses to speak his mind, how could anyone ever fathom what he truly intends?

Our Sovereign's indulgence toward him knows no bounds, so much so that he can no longer distinguish right from wrong. Whether his actions were just or misguided, the Sovereign would always respond with gentle agreement. And precisely because of this, his unease only grows deeper. No matter which path he takes, he is always met with the same tender light, leaving him utterly lost as to which road he truly walks. In the end, his suspicions toward his kin are nothing but reflections of his self-doubt.

I pity him.
