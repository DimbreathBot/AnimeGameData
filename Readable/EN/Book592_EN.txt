...The inscription has long been lost, and mortals have no inkling of its form.
...to the descendants of the divine bird, bound to where destiny was decreed.
As a land where the Pari of the Vourukasha Oasis have long dwelled.
As a land guarded by Barsom's familiar.
As a land defended by thorns like blades.
Or as the Tunigi Catastrophe... remnants of ash and wizened husks... zenith.
