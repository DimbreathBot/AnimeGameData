Today, I spent the entire afternoon arguing with representatives from the merchant association. Energy <color=#FF5341>-4</color>.
Many things must still be settled. I need to ensure that they allow the goods to flow smoothly, but I must make sure that their money is made through legal means...

Today, I finished a day's worth of work. Energy <color=#FF5341>-3</color>.
I'll have to write up another batch of directives tonight. Hopefully, this won't go on too late. I still need to perform an inspection tomorrow.

The wind is very strong outside. Energy <color=#FF5341>-2</color>.
It seems like it will rain soon. I can only hope that the waves aren't as rough, and those who go out fishing can return safely.

News of the peace talks reached us today. Energy <color=#00E1FFFF>+2</color>.

Today, we received word that the Tenryou Commission might be colluding with the Fatui. Energy <color=#FF5341>-5</color>.

Swordfish II's captain came back today. Energy <color=#00E1FFFF>+4</color>.

Lots of people spoke to me today again. Energy <color=#FF5341>-3</color>.
