Chief Stalanov and Mr. Shesternin were scheduled to meet on the deck. The agreed-upon time arrived, but Mr. Shesternin was nowhere to be seen. We asked his companion, Zhorik, who was unusually calm and spoke with a coldness that felt out of place. He claimed to "know nothing" of Mr. Shesternin's whereabouts, but when told his cabin might be searched, an almost undetectable sense of panic seemed to flash across his face, before quickly donning a mask of concern. He took great pains to emphasize Mr. Shesternin's obsession with machinery and attempted to convince us that his absence was coincidental. My intuition tells me he's lying.
I hope this matter can be concluded before we reach Nasha Town.
