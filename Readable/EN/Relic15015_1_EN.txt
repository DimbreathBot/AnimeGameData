A beautiful water balloon filled with water.
In the ghost stories of Inazuma,
This is a memento from a chance meeting with something inhuman...

During the summer festival, I was separated from my parents.
It was but a moment, but I had wanted to look at the water balloons,
And let go my hand that had gripped on to my father's sleeve.
Before we knew it, the tide of people escorting the divine palanquin had washed us apart.

I cried by the torii gates along the road to the shrine,
And I counted the feet of the people ascending the mountain.
I do not know when it happened,
But a beautiful lady with fox-like eyes had come to my side, and taken my hand.

"How preposterous, to leave such an adorable child here."
"So, how about it? Would you like to see the fireworks, throw some darts, and play fusen with me?"
