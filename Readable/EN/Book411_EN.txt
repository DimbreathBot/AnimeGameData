Esteemed Prinzessin of the Immernachtreich,
I am a witch who travels amidst the mountains and rivers of Teyvat.
I write to you, having heard from my young daughter that your kingdom has fallen and that you are searching for a way to restore it.
Amid the seas under a far-flung sky may the Golden Apple Archipelago be found.
If this masterless land can assist in the restoration of Your Highness's realms, that would be most wonderful!
