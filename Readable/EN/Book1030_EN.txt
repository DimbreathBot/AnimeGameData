To test the efficiency of complex structures and the Phlogiston power unit, such that a Secret Source Servant can be manufactured for the purposes of record-keeping...
Intended to perform precise adjustment and control of Phlogiston during the second stage of the plan, and to provide insurance in case of contingencies.
If the full-scale Phlogistonization experiment becomes unstable, a physical system will be required to maintain a quasi-Phlogiston state. In this scenario, we will need to rely on these small mechanisms to perform maintenance duties.

To think my memory had been corroded to such an extent by the time the prototype could be constructed...
I can no longer even recall... how long it has been since the days when my people would unfurl their wings and soar freely above this land.
I cannot even... Haha. I cannot even recall the figure who should have stood beside my empty throne.
Never mind... He shall one day return to this city. This I believe.

I can understand the need for Secret Source Automatons to maintain the mechanisms, and as a backup plan for the second stage...
But must they have been constructed in such a way? Other shapes would have made more efficient use of the energy source...
Moreover, my pitiable brother, lost to delusions... Know that your descendants merely copying your prototype blindly, having no comprehension of its significance.
Their ignorance is such that the Secret Source Servants they create are even smaller than your prototype — so as not to "usurp" the magnificence of your creation.
Laughable, isn't it, how this non-uniformity creates unnecessary wastage in their assembly...

...Who would have imagined that these Secret Source Servants, built merely to maintain mechanisms and unarmed to boot, would manage to survive the war?
It appears that — in imitation of your ways — they left their own marks at the cores of the Secret Source Servants they created.
By this can I tell these identical facsimiles apart and know who created each one.
...I have given them the names of their creators... For what purpose, one might ask? Remembrance, perhaps?
If you could see me now, brother, you would laugh at my foolishness.
It seems that in this withered city whose life has run its course... I, too...

How peculiar... I am unable to change the name of your prototype... It seems that even I lack the relevant authority. It is hard to believe... that you would leave something such as this for yourself.
Perhaps it is because the Abyssal corruption of the Sacred City is so severe. In this colossal metropolis constructed from Phlogiston... data and structure exist as one.
Yes... The city itself is built of data sectors made manifest... so if the sector containing the prototype's data has been corrupted, the name cannot be read, and therefore cannot be changed.
I wonder... What name did you give this machine?
Or have names themselves lost all meaning in this place? Perhaps you never gave it a name to begin with...
