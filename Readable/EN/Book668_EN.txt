...Following Guillotin's instructions, the research went well... We've created a clockwork meka that can release energy. To be honest, we no longer need to call it a clockwork machine as it doesn't rely on elastic potential... It'll be compelling to see what results he achieves next in kinematics. There's no way old-fashioned clockwork meka can withstand such power output. Even young geniuses must stumble now and then...

...
...The thought of using this sort of unstable energy source is impressive. Though we have long observed these unique energies in Fontaine's atmosphere, water, and organisms, it has always been regarded as a latent threat, rather than a potential resource...

...
...Aren't there a few young geniuses too many nowadays? The director is pleased, sure, but won't someone spare a thought for us ordinary people? I mean, not all of us are as simpleminded as Scherbius...

...
...It received a very high rating. If the patent were to be granted, the potential financial gain would be considerable. However, I decided to decline the opportunity, because the machine was practically all Guillotin's work, and I can take no credit there. My family was quite angry about it, but as an engineer, one must have at least a little dignity and self-awareness...
...Still making improvements, and output efficiency has increased...

...
...Seems to have been specially recruited. That's good. Had he continued that line of research, who knows what horrors he might have unleashed...

...
...At this stage, we have to pull out. The director says everyone will be given a position and research resources after reconstruction, but I'm afraid if it were me, I would use this as an excuse for a major shake-up. People like me won't get recalled anyway. Never mind. I've been pretty happy these past few days, I guess I'll consider it my retirement. I'll go to the city and open a small workshop, repairing watches for folks, Kameras too. Right, I'll see if I can make a waterproof clock. With the way things are going, I might make a killing in the future.
