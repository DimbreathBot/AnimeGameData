1
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:14,000
What have you done!?

2
00:00:15,325 --> 00:00:16,200
Calm down

3
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:18,550
Don't you have an easy way to figure this out?

4
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:27,000
You were only designated as Number 36?

5
00:00:27,075 --> 00:00:27,950
What a shame

6
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:30,750
From what I can see, your talents merit a smaller number

7
00:00:31,075 --> 00:00:32,825
Putting aside the validity of the data

8
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,950
It is meaningless to judge individuals based solely on their Jnana Energy

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,075
What you said to Ilyas

10
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,500
Has now become a memory shared by all members of the Hive...

11
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:45,375
I see it now

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,725
You've channeled and amplified their selfish desires!

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,625
You're trying to destroy my Hive from the inside out!

14
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,900
Human minds are not infinitely pliable

15
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,200
And your Hive has stretched many of them to their limit

16
00:00:57,275 --> 00:01:00,100
Once your authority as Overmind starts to wane

17
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:03,100
It won't be long before your subjects snap back

18
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:09,875
"Is it worth living here like a machine, being a tool for the rest of my life?"

19
00:01:10,425 --> 00:01:13,420
As soon as one person begins to have these thoughts

20
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:19,375
Selfishness, doubt, and fear will propagate thanks to the web of consciousness that you built

21
00:01:19,675 --> 00:01:24,800
At this stage, your so-called Hive has already fallen

22
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,375
It's not over yet!

23
00:01:29,025 --> 00:01:31,100
I am the Overmind!

24
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,275
There has to be a way...

25
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:39,525
It's too late

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,075
Once the desires of the Hive accumulate...

27
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,650
Beyond a certain threshold, they will kill their king

28
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,075
I wouldn't have suffered such a disgraceful defeat

29
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,525
If I was the Overmind...

30
00:01:53,775 --> 00:01:55,825
My number shouldn't be so far down in the list!

31
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,725
Siraj is a liar!

32
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,275
This isn't what we agreed to...

33
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,975
I should be the one in your position!
