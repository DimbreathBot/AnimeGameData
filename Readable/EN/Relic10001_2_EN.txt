The wandering traveler had once against lost a place to call home.

The condescending evil stole his love's joy,
And the endless conflict ground down his irreverent soul.
Those gentle, playful rhythms of revelry,
Now turned to sharp, icy clangs.

For freedom, for life, and for revenge against the evil that had taken her smile.
Thus resolved, the traveler plucked his last string, and fired his final arrow.

As he grew accustomed to life in this foreign land, he gazed up at the azure sky.
Ah, so the sky here was the same as the one back in his homeland...
