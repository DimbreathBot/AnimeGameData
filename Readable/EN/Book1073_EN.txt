O craftsman who unrolls these scrolls, my name is Nare Magan Sundjatta, the 52nd chief of Nanatzcayan. I am Mbande's successor. I shall be like Daurama, Nayoga, and Sanhaj. I will weave ancient texts into a tapestry, I shall speak of the foundations of phlogiston-forging, and spare you needless detours.

Chapter V: Another Possibility for Phlogiston-Forging Techniques

According to the scroll left behind by our great-mother, Sakkuk, the techniques of phlogiston-forging originated from the ancient dragons. In their era, there existed a more marvelous forging method beyond present imagination, one that directly forged Phlogiston into different materials.

Such mastery was witnessed by Sakkuk, and the founding pioneer, Ixquieh, earned her title as "Hero of the Forged Flame" by truly understanding how to smelt phlogiston itself. She was no dragon — but having had no parents to grant her a name, she named herself in draconic tongue and style. So in theory, mastery of this advanced phlogiston-forging art was within human reach.

Regrettably, Ixquieh's manuscripts number few and far between. She set fire to her own workshop, including her writings about forging, and took her own life while forcing her brother do the same, to avoid his leaving a tarnished legacy like that of Och-Kan. In a sense, it was she who slew her own kin, Teteocan's first chief. I cannot pass judgment on that choice, as each era has its morals. Yet the loss of such craftsmanship is regretful, and haunts future smiths still.

The 13th chief, Hun Toh, — may fire bless his name — spent his entire life trying to grasp the art of phlogiston-forging, but found no success. I tried it in my youth and failed as well. To you, smiths of future ages: You may try, but do not squander your years and strength. For weaving matter with phlogiston is like building an unshakable house from ground Grainfruit dust, all while tracking the placement of each speck. One misstep, and the entire structure will collapse. Based on my experience, with our current technological constraints, ordinary humans cannot attain this great endeavor. Therefore, I advise you to focus on using phlogiston as a supplementary material for tempering metals and jade rather than treating it as the foundational substrate of your forging.

But this does not spell our defeat, nor our inability to surpass our ancestors and the ancient dragons. Remember, phlogiston is but a tool, and as a craftsman, it is your hand that guides the tool, not the other way around. After all, only a craftsman — you, a human — can materialize ideas and concepts into reality.

In fact, many recorded ideas from Sakkuk's time have been realized by now, even though no smith in these centuries has ever mastered the forging of phlogiston itself. Take, for instance, golden discs that preserve song and melody, platforms suspended briefly aloft by phlogiston, or vehicles that may carry us over all manner of terrain. Such marvels abound! Future generations of craftsmen — may they live in peaceful times — might build upon these techniques to achieve wonders beyond our era's imagination. This is the legacy of Nanatzcayan: A "blessing" born of mortal hands, not the boon of gods or masters.
