The assigned assistant doesn't seem very reliable.
At the moment, it doesn't look like the power sources of those war machines can be used. Their cores are far too dangerous.
I'll get them to seek out other such mysterious machines.

...
No progress worth reporting today.
Went out with Ann under the watchful eyes of my adoptive father to look for inspiration at sites where battles took place. Ran into Rene and Jakob.

...
The assistant doesn't seem reliable. Caused some accidents. Just another obstacle to overcome.
This kind of machine with the seemingly arbitrary external form is quite interesting. Research will focus on their power source.

Asked Ann for help.
Recommended Rene and Jakob to the director of the Institute.

My assistant still isn't back. I'll go to pay a visit.
Found Rene and Jakob's adoptive father with my own adoptive father's help.

...
The supplementary primenergy machines have arrived. Should be able to make progress now.
Assistant seems to be in good spirits. Probably just a minor illness.

Rene and Jakob joined the Institute. They've been assigned to my project.

Field research today.
Interesting machine statue.

My adoptive father visited, but I was too busy to host him. Ann scolded me. I'll remember to apologize next time I see him.

On the threshold of a major breakthrough.
Forgot about the visit, am sorry. Will invite everyone to go with me.

Assistant took the day off. Went to visit.
An idea: a virtual neural network based on a vast quantity of thinking units instead of logic trees.
A Kamera?

A breakthrough.
Patent application process is too annoying. Forget it.
Assistant's condition seems okay. Still a little worried.
Considering the gap in medical technology, advised assistant to go to Sumeru.

Researching machine kinematics next.
Must make a materials list.

They said a bigger lab has been prepared for the kinematic experiments.
But I've decided not to move for now.

Been urged to move the lab several times.
But if the lab is moved, my assistant might not be able to find it. A pain.
