...Couldn't take it. I threw up every last drop of the Grainfruit Soup I'd drunk this morning while no one was looking. Still can't stop my hands from shaking.

Why were these (...) ever permitted to exist? If there really was a secret treasure that could destroy the Abyss, then why are those things still moving?

At least... at least they can now find peace. Their souls may have been ripped to shreds oh so long ago, but at least... They no longer need to exist in that state...

Uncle Copan tried to comfort me by saying that they can be freed so long as we find the Python King's treasure. But were that the case, why did the Python King die in the Abyss?

No. I must not fear. I must not waver. If even the Spiritcaller from the Masters of the Night-Wind were to falter...

I must... For everyone...
