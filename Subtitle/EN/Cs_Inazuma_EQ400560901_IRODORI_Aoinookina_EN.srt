1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,288
That figure was none other than Aoi no Okina himself

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,680
This turn of events had begun with an unnamed individual

3
00:00:07,872 --> 00:00:10,800
Under whose coercion Aoi no Okina was forced

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,208
To take drastic measures to retrieve a page of poetry

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,400
He knew nothing

6
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:17,664
Of this individual's true intentions 

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,275
All he knew was that

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,950
The poem had to do with an old acquaintance, Akahito
