(This sheet of paper has already gone yellow with age. The scribbled words on it read as follows...)
I found some discarded records. They may have been left behind by people most ancient indeed.
Hah. Well, perhaps my records, too, will one day be regarded by people from the future as "something that ancient people left behind"... But enough of that for now.
I found some clues regarding what must have happened back then.
Here, it writes... "As arranged by that poor fellow with only half a face left, we must first shut off the power to the city"...
A person with half a face left... Sounds like some character from a horror story.
But based on this description, the "hollows" were shut down by human action...
"After that, we need to cut off the combustion device's core energy supply area... Such that our Grand Alliance Ordnance officer can take advantage of the chaos to bring that person, the great one, before the royal hall."
"The one to whom this task has been assigned is that half-faced fellow... With any luck, he will be more reliable in deed than in word or plan."
Hmm... I'm sure I've heard mention of the position of Grand Alliance Ordnance Officer somewhere before...
In any case, the group that shut this place down appear to have headed to a more important core area.
If... If I can find something there, the top prize from the Saurian Relics Association will surely be mine!
That way, even the fact that I didn't get permission to pass the Flower-Feather Clan blockade to sneak in here and conduct research will not open me up to criticism.
