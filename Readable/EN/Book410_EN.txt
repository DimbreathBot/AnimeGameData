Something quite amusing happened today that I just have to preserve in my diary: the young master got a little tipsy. Well, a lot tipsy, haha.
It must be said that the young master is way underage to drink at all. Not knowing any better, he must've confused his father's drink with his own, mistaking that glass of wine for grape juice.
From a distance, I noticed someone practicing martial arts in the courtyard. I expected it to be our young master, which I wasn't wrong in assuming, but I never expected to see him in such a state — that is to say, utterly sloshed.
He greeted me in high spirits, and if it wasn't for his lobster-red face, I wouldn't have suspected anything.
Overdrinking on a summer night is hardly a crime. But considering his age, I simply felt that I had to keep an eye on him.
At first, I wanted to pretend that I didn't see it. I even made a detour to take things out to the backyard so as to spare him the embarrassment.
By the time I finished my work, the young master was already lying on the steps, asleep. Ah, what a rare sight it was to see this precocious young man revealing this side of him... A right sight indeed.
Another servant and I quietly carried the young master back inside and prepared some tea and snacks to help him sober up and ease the discomfort later. He might have called his parents' names while sleeping. His eyes closed, he looked so contented. Perhaps he had dreamed of some happy moments in his past.
Dear young master, you still have a long life ahead of you. There shall be plenty of opportunities to drink — in the future, that is.
