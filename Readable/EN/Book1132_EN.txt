In accordance with the statutes laid down by [...], all matters concerning Mekhaneikos and Tekhneikos shall be recorded objectively, concisely, and untainted by personal sentiment. Thus shall we guard against the distortion of truth via subjectivity, that the knowledge we possess may be transmitted with clarity to future generations, and serve the welfare of our people to the fullest possible extent.

The contents of this document have been approved by Spargapiris of Haxathrausa. All members of the order, beginning with the executive priests, shall commit its contents to memory and observe the prescribed procedures without deviation, until the reconstruction of civilization has reached five-sevenths completion (for further details, consult Tekhneikos Manual I-330).

...
If these words have reached your eyes, let it be known that you have completed the foundational disciplines of Mekhaneikos or Tekhneikos, and are hereby elevated to the rank of executive priest. Congratulations are in order.
Regrettably, your newly acquired title is not a privilege, but a burden of duty, hardship, and silent suffering borne for this realm and the countless lives she shelters.
You are destined to offer all of your youth and your life to preserve the last embers of civilization. Yet even with your final breath, you may never behold the Frostmoon's radiant light, nor see the dawn break once more upon our beautiful homeland. For the lights of the far north have been extinguished, and countless generations are condemned to cower in darkest night. No miracle has ever graced this tainted sublunary sphere, and tears have never delivered our kin from sorrow.
Then what purpose, if any, lies in all that you shall do from this moment hence?
I suppose, then, it is for an ethereal dream. A dream of countless tomorrows, for an infinity of futures yet unborn.
Only through our blood, our tears, and our toil shall our children be granted the chance to behold the glorious era and the lost Elysium we once knew. On that day, none shall weep for suffering, nor fear hunger or cold. All beings shall love one another as brothers and sisters, and all shall dwell in joy and peace.
This shall be our final and greatest dream: That our kin shall no longer be mired in superstition and barbarism. For the hope once envisioned by gods and mortals alike, we must push forward. There is no path but through.
Sear these words into your mind before you proceed to read the assessment records and operating procedures.
Hold fast to our dream of tomorrow, and let not its light be dimmed by the dust of neglect.
— Spargapiris of Haxathrausa, Acting Archpriestess of Hyperborea

Protocol III: Final Evaluation on Bloodline Selection and Purification
Upon evaluation and confirmation by the Acting Archpriestess and the Senior Executive Tekhneikos Priestess, the Seed of Life Project from the Hyperborea era —henceforth referred to as the Sacred Heir Project — has been deemed to no longer be viable within the bounds of its original planned parameters. The priest who led the project, Vinda of Hithamthrausa, has passed beyond, and the essential Tekhneikos processes and Mekhaneikos apparatuses required for its continuation were lost in the fall of Hyperborea. These include, but are not limited to:
· The process of [...] cutting and modification;
· The process of [...] creation and reconstruction;
· The [...] and [...] processes, which were of the fae;
· The adaptive [...] editing process;
· ...
The aforementioned Tekhneikos processes are, at present, irreproducible.

After due deliberation, the following alternative protocol has been deemed acceptable:
· The purification of existing [...] is to be performed through controlled artificial selection, using methods primitive and inefficient.
· The phenotypic stability of each generation shall be recorded. Then, from this data, the most suitable pairs for union shall be identified, and non-coercive means employed to persuade the parties to join in union.
· Should persuasion fail to meet the criteria detailed in Tekhneikos Manual O-90, promptly proceed to the next priority match, and continue in like fashion.
· To minimize risk of disease, the Bloodline Proximity Index of all breeding pairs shall not exceed [...]. Accordingly, no individuals shall be joined in union if they share common ancestry within five generations.

This course of action is expected to yield outcomes approaching the original objective after [...] successive generations of refinement and selection. At such time, the one prophesied, the newborn Sacred Heir, shall arise. Without the need for ritual implements, nor the forfeiture of their soul, this heir shall command the pure, unaltered elemental forces at will, and shall at last attain fusion with the World.

Note: In light of projected population growth and the limits of environmental carrying capacity, it is anticipated that the practice of widespread artificial breeding may be terminated after seven generations. Thereafter, limited intermarriage with select outlanders may then be sanctioned (details in Tekhneikos Manual I-1012). Furthermore, it is hereby affirmed that, once the continuity of civilization has been assured, the descendants of the far north shall be granted the sovereign right to determine their own destinies.

Protocol VI: The Subatomic Assembling Mass-Energy Patterning Orb (Sealed)
The project of constructing this supremely advanced Mekhaneikos construct was personally overseen by [...] and is not fully understood at this time. It was designed to reconstruct matter at the subatomic scale, or to transmute matter directly into stable energy, which would then be released in the form of [...].

Of all the known highest-tier Mekhaneikos constructs dating to the time of Hyperborea, only the Subatomic Assembling Mass-energy Patterning Orb (hereafter referred to as the "SAMPO") has endured to the present age. Its structure remains largely intact, granting it immense symbolic significance. However, a formal evaluation by the Acting Archpriestess and the Senior Executive Mekhaneikos Priestess has determined that the device, in its current state, is no longer functional. The collaborative control module connected to the device was lost during the fall of Hyperborea and cannot be replicated with existing technologies. In the absence of this module, proper activation of the SAMPO is impossible, and it is presumed that even a forced restart would fail to correctly reconfigure said device (refer to appendix for more details).

After due deliberation, it is resolved that the device shall be sealed indefinitely, with no re-evaluation of its activation viability for a period of [...] generations. All personnel without explicit authorization from the Archpriestess may not breach the seal. This will prevent unnecessary accidental damage to the device.

Note: The Senior Executive Mekhaneikos Priestess, Ariapeithea of Massagetae, has proposed a theoretically viable bypass protocol. Namely, the controlled input of [...] Realm Energy or [...] Realm Energy (refer to Mekhaneikos Manual D-503 for the possibility of the latter) at a specific carrier frequency, which may circumvent the collaborative control module and forcibly initiate the SAMPO. Upon formal evaluation, however, the proposed method was determined to pose unacceptable safety risks, with the probability of system destabilization and ensuing [...] exceeding [...]. In light of these findings, the original decision shall stand.

Protocol X: The Arrow of Terpikeraunas
The subject of the project is a low-tier Mekhaneikos device of the Hyperborea era, designed to solidify [...] Realm Energy into a semi-crystalline polymeric form. Once stabilized, the material is subjected to a high-frequency [...] spiral acceleration and subsequently launched, thereby purging a designated area of [...] Realm Energy contamination.

The Acting Archpriestess and the Senior Executive Mekhaneikos Priestess have jointly affirmed that the device's remanufacture is viable. This work shall proceed under the oversight of Senior Executive Mekhaneikos Priestess Ariapeithea of Massagetae, with the prototype device projected for completion within [...] standard quarters.

Upon completion, the prototype apparatus shall be subject to regular lubrication with ointments to prevent avoidable safety incidents. (Refer to Mekhaneikos Manual D-306 for more details.)
