1
00:00:00,544 --> 00:00:02,194
In our last tale

2
00:00:02,194 --> 00:00:05,729
Rex Lapis was walking alone in the mountains

3
00:00:05,827 --> 00:00:09,131
He heard a remote voice unlike any other

4
00:00:09,131 --> 00:00:11,481
Coming from a crack in the earth

5
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:19,311
Most of the ancient Geo life forms that live below Liyue are blind

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,369
Having not seen the sunlight for an age

7
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:30,772
The voice was sometimes sad and songlike, other times it was loud and thunderous

8
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:33,267
The Lord of Geo searched here and there

9
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:37,943
Before finally unearthing a strange stone from the bedrock

10
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,819
That's how Azhdaha was

11
00:00:42,682 --> 00:00:46,326
I answered his wish, and took him above ground

12
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:51,965
The Lord of Geo took pity on the rock's spirit

13
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:59,017
And carved it into a magnificent work of craftsmanship â€” a vivid representation of a dragon

14
00:00:59,213 --> 00:01:02,398
I bestowed him with a pair of eyes to see the world

15
00:01:02,398 --> 00:01:04,465
And came to an agreement with him

16
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:08,159
With his fingers, he made two eyes

17
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,129
Quicker than words could tell, lightning flashed and thunder roared

18
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:15,975
And a living, breathing dragon soared into the clouds!

19
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,125
I agreed to let him live among the people above ground

20
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:24,383
But if the day ever came when he brought ruin to order

21
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:27,126
He would once again be sealed in the dark

22
00:01:27,677 --> 00:01:30,585
The dragon accompanied the Lord of Geo

23
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:35,150
Fighting campaigns alongside him in the four corners of the world

24
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:38,401
We have a saying to eulogize these events:

25
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:41,643
"The crash of a spear brought billowing dust"

26
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:45,251
"The mountains and waters made way at the sound"

27
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:48,697
"The sight of a dragon bestowed with a touch"

28
00:01:48,697 --> 00:01:52,749
"The promise of rainwater blessing the ground"
