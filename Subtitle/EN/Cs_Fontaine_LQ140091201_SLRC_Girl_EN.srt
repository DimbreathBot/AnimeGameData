1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,519
It's raining!

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,440
Oh no

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,239
Paimon forgot to bring an umbrella...

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:07,920
Come on

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,360
Let's hurry before it rains harder!

6
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,119
Ugh, it's raining again?

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,639
I've had enough of this weather

8
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,599
There go my travel plans...

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,880
Did you read the news this morning?

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,480
Quick

11
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:44,679
Put away everything on the clotheslines!

12
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,800
When is this rain going to stop...

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,079
Hydro Dragon, Hydro Dragon, don't cry!

14
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:13,440
They're planning to reanimate the monster...

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,760
We have to report this to the Chief Justice

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,440
The Fortress of Meropide...

17
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:26,679
It's a good place for me

18
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:42,920
He owes me so many answers...

19
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,400
Neuvillette?

20
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,199
You could say he's the real symbol of Fontaine's justice

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,800
Watch him closely

22
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,840
He could be trouble

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,280
How can two completely different species possibly coexist?

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,360
Who's been threatening Melusines?

25
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:05,440
Show yourself!

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,880
You will see much

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,960
In the human world

28
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,559
From the delightful to the depressing...

29
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,159
And one day, when you have dwelt among humanity long enough

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,480
You will be placed to bring judgment over all

31
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,039
As the spokesperson for Fontaine's past

32
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,760
Good morning, Monsieur Neuvillette!

33
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,159
The rainy season's almost over...

34
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,199
The skies are supposed to clear in a few days

35
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:38,125
I hope you find time to enjoy the sunny days ahead
