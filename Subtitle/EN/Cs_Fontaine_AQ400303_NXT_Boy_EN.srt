1
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,275
So this is how justice is done in Fontaine

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,650
What a joke

3
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:16,875
You've got your rules...

4
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:19,150
Well, I've got mine too

5
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:40,450
Heh...

6
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:52,950
Ah!

7
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:54,475
He's activating his Foul Legacy!

8
00:01:07,725 --> 00:01:09,075
I am sorry

9
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:11,900
If you have been wronged, we will find the truth

10
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,025
But the rules of the court

11
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:15,824
Must be upheld
