I hope this letter finds you all well!

I didn't expect to be asked such a question, which caused quite a headache at first... I only know how to guide people in the geological sense, but on the journey of life, I'm still the lost kid who needs the guidance of others.

But upon seeing your question, I immediately knew what I can help with. I tried drawing a map showing vegetation distribution for Mr. Tighnari and Ms. Collei, as well as a dragon-spotting calendar for Mr. Cyno. Both are attached below.

In the next few days, I will need to patrol with the Captain and draw maps for Ms. Lisa, so I can only support you with my well-wishes. My apologies! Please forgive me!

I hope the map and the list will be of some help to you.
