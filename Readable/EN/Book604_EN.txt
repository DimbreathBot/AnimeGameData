...After scouring the land for days, I have finally found the Korybantes. Alas, I lack the strength to retrieve them. As such, I will record their locations here...

...There is no detailed information on the key contents of the ritual. I have drawn the following inferences from a comprehensive review of the current body of research:
Firstly, the element of the Korybantes matches the element recorded on the drum score.
This is obvious, and requires only a rudimentary understanding.
Anemo and Geo Drums do not exist. The reason for this merits further investigation.
Secondly, the meaning behind the notation.
Notation may be divided into three categories: empty, half-full, full. The hypothesis is that the musical notes refer to three types of rhythms, namely: pause, light, and heavy.
Thirdly, the order of reading.
Unable to be determined. If a lost Kory Drum is found, one can try to read it in the usual order, which is from left to right and top to bottom.
