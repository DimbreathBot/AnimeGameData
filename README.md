# GenshinData
Repository containing the release data for Genshin Impact.

## Support

If you would like to support the work done to create and maintain the data repositories, you can do so here: https://patreon.com/Dimbreath.

It is not a requirement, this is only a tip jar which I had decided to add given that a lot of the content created with this repository is monetized via ads. It is heavily appreciated and would mean a lot as this is done in my spare time and the work is very time consuming, and sometimes difficult due to changes, in order to continue to provide (almost) complete dumps as you see on the repositories.

If you use the data for your site, tool, guide, etc. a thanks in some credits page would be heavily appreciated!
