—Modest Fortune—
The clouds hang low in the sky, and they will build up further still.
Sooner or later, a thunderstorm will suddenly come crashing down from above.
Yet the rainbow awaits at the end of the storm.
Stick to tried and tested ways and maintain peace. Act rashly, and you may struggle to succeed.

Your lucky object for the day: Fallen Pinecone
Not all pinecones can grow into large pine trees.
Growth requires the right environment, but also a little luck.
So don't put too much pressure on yourself. Wait patiently for the rainbow.
