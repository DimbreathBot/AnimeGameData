It was a time before the dark disaster engulfed the nations,
A time when people still savored those last golden years.

It is said that there was an erudite and gifted researcher who wandered the nations for many years.
He had already read every Rtawahist chronicle, browsed the libraries of the northern lands.
However, even after searching in the oldest records, he could not find what he was looking for—
That pitch-black Elysium — miraculous, and not of this world.

He had traveled to every corner of the known world, save for that barren, still-undeveloped land.
That was the northern borderland known as Nod-Krai. It had only been a few years ago that the Tsar of Snezhnaya ordered it to be explored and put to use.
No famous researchers dwelled there, nor did it seem to contain any traces of ancient civilizations.

"O futile life that I have led! This shall be my final post."
He thought before setting off for Nod-Krai.
"Hope may be gone, but I cannot give up now."

Once more, he glimpsed the truth he had long pursued... Perhaps because his wish had finally been heard and heeded.
And at last, he uncovered the sinful path that opened into the pitch-black Elysium.
Now, all that remained was for him to open the gate — one that had shone in countless dreams — with his own two hands,
No matter the means, and no matter the price that had to be paid...
