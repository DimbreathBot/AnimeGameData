1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:06,144
As promised, the Raiden Shogun abolished the Vision Hunt Decree

2
00:00:07,025 --> 00:00:11,025
Finally, her people's wishes penetrated her locked heart

3
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:20,037
Beyond the Plane of Euthymia, she saw what eternity means in the eyes of the world

4
00:00:24,586 --> 00:00:27,250
When one's fervent ambition burns brightly

5
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,950
The gods will cast their gaze upon you

6
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,800
Some ambitions

7
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:42,525
Have the power to heal wounds

8
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,261
To bring victory

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,569
To inspire hope

10
00:00:54,372 --> 00:00:55,775
But some ambitions

11
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:03,780
Outlive their masters, long after the soul ascends

12
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,851
They remain as they were in the beginning

13
00:01:14,802 --> 00:01:17,211
Burning bright and true

14
00:01:19,963 --> 00:01:21,725
For all eternity
