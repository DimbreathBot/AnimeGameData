...Know this, brethren...

...Not once has the Sage ever cared about humanity's survival. For the sake of the path of "evolution," the Sage was even willing to sacrifice the future of its own kind...
...Heaven cares not about the wills of those who dwell in this world. We are viewed as pillars that bear up the earth, necessary for the struggle against its personal foes...

...And so, we may rely on neither the wisdom of dragons nor the Lord of the Night's might, nor may we pray to any god other than the one and only Pyro Archon...

...

...The only road left to us is the path of Xbalanque...

(Mine foolish heir, O you who assert such narrow opinions of species. "Evolution" is a mingled thing, not pure and untainted as you have imagined. That is precisely why "evolution" opposes "eternity.")
