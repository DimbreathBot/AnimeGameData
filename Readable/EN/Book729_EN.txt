The above are the three principles of the Mutual Aid Network. All are welcome to join and membership is free. There are no compulsory group events.
The Mutual Aid Network encourages members to do what they are able, including but not limited to cleaning, exercising, tutoring, and studying.
It is hoped that all Mutual Aid Network members will, during their time in the Fortress of Meropide, face up to the crimes they have committed. Encourage each other, support each other, and welcome the future together.
