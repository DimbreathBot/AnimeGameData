1
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,022
Azar...

2
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:30,810
Well, what do we have here... So you stole that Divine Knowledge Capsule

3
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,900
Traitor... You, traitor...

4
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:41,975
Even the most rational scholar will yearn for the power of a god in a moment of desperation

5
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:44,600
Aren't you doing the exact same thing as me

6
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:46,050
Alhaitham?

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,675
Unfortunately for you, no god will lend you their power

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,150
Azar!!

9
00:01:05,475 --> 00:01:07,866
He has gone completely insane

10
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,075
Take him to the matra, and exile him to Aaru Village

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,925
Then, find someone to take these two to the confinement room

12
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,875
I'll deal with them later

13
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,525
Grand Sage, we have finished all required preparations for Jnagarbha Day

14
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:35,550
We may begin to enter the capsules now

15
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,850
Excellent. You may begin
