The subject displayed a fear absent in vishaps and an empathy toward fallen enemies unseen in humans. Though the subject was briefly incapacitated, all physiological indicators remained within safe parameters and no medical intervention was required. A report has been sent to the Regent..."

"...By order of the Regent, the hunt protocol has been rescinded on the grounds of having personally neutralized the subject. Record concluded."
