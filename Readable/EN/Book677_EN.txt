Outrageously, it would seem that your paper hasn't a shred of remorse.
Having not yet caught the attention of the authorities, I made good on my promise by dismembering Sir Arthur and burying him in a field. Buried with him are your paper's evil deeds from 30 years ago.
Furthermore, I have spread the word â€” treasure maps or "clues to Dr. Mosso's base" shall surely make the treasure hunters come flocking, no?
Soon, your misdeeds shall come to light, alongside that bird's remains.
Crow or Blackbird?
