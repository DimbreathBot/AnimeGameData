When I was flipping through some old books today, I found my father's old notes.
I read them, of course. He wouldn't mind. As I expected, most of the content concerned forging techniques as well as tricks on how to handle certain ores.
The tail end featured a number of hand-drawn drafts, mostly bonsai designs. Well, I suppose this love for them does count as a clan tradition.
My son turns six this year. His name is "Kazuha," just as my wife wished.
...
His coming and her going were not far apart. To think that it has been six years since then... If she were still here, she would surely be helping my father in the yard.
My father lived well in his younger years, and that lifestyle has greatly deteriorated in his latter ones. It fills me with shame to admit that I am unable to improve these circumstances.
He says that it is not important, however, and that it is instead we who are young who are the key.
