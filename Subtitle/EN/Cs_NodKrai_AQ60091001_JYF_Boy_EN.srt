00:00:00,585 --> 00:00:02,285
<i>You, who are superfluous... (fae language)</i>

2
00:00:03,321 --> 00:00:05,305
<i>You, who are lonely... (fae language)</i>

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,043
<i>The complacent invite in catastrophe... (fae language)</i>

4
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:13,248
<i>It's too late to make up for your folly now... (fae language)</i>

5
00:00:13,426 --> 00:00:14,665
<i>Lies and falsehoods! (fae language)</i>

6
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:26,923
Hand it over

7
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,951
That was mine from the first

8
00:00:30,544 --> 00:00:33,590
<i>It is hereby permanently requisitioned (fae language)</i>

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,101
You are a fool!

10
00:00:39,175 --> 00:00:40,471
You again

11
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,955
What the... It's stronger than before...

12
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:55,777
Lantern, now!

13
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,040
What...

14
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:39,425
Tch

15
00:01:40,487 --> 00:01:41,814
It escaped again

16
00:01:44,554 --> 00:01:47,282
This situation... speaks for itself, I presume?
