...All that once granted me form is fading. I can feel the power being twisted, diluted... to nourish, to form, ah... Something from beyond, our shadowy bane...

...Time is running low. Before all things terminate, I must find a new path for my people... A path forever lit and free from the darkness of shadows...

...Even if no glorious end awaits... If I shall be swallowed by shadows, ravaged by flame... It matters not...

...But how can I forsake... the future of my kin...
