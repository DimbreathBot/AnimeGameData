<color=#FFE14BFF>Cold Cut Platter</color>
As the largest meat provider in Mondstadt, we understand the struggles our customers face:
"Which is the most delicious? Sausage, ham, or bacon?"
<color=#FFE14BFF>Sausages</color>, made by mincing and mixing the finest meat, are often seen as a meat lover's greatest delight, but chewy <color=#FFE14BFF>ham</color> dried to perfection is an equally irresistible delicacy. And who could neglect indulgent, oily <color=#FFE14BFF>bacon</color>, which works wonders in any dish to which it is added...
For all the fellow meat lovers out there who, just like us, struggle to make this impossible choice between three different forms of perfection incarnate, Good Hunter's <color=#FFE14BFF>Cold Cut Platter</color> is the perfect solution for you!
The platter consists of the finest Good Hunter sausages, Wolvendom boar bacon, and ham dried in the winds of our archon, served in equal portions for your maximum pleasure! Our golden platter comes served with precious wild Mint from Dragonspine, which is sure to keep the meat Cryo fresh!
Thanks to the <color=#FFE14BFF>Good Hunter's Special Cold Cut Platter</color>, heaven is a place on earth for every meat lover in Mondstadt!
