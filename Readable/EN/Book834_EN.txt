Potton:
Who's this Potton? I'm Honore! I had applied to go out and see a doctor, but when I woke up, I was in another cell! Unbelievable!

Gascon:
I'm not Gascon, I'm Houilles! Today should've been the final day of my sentence, so I should've gone free. What gives!?

Enri:
I'm Erick! Why does stuff like this always happen to me? Now there's no way my release papers are getting squared away today...

Lazare:
My name is Odilon! I'm a Garde! I think I was attacked... This isn't me at all!
