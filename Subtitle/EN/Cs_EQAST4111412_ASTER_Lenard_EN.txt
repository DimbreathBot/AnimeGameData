1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,671
With ropes, we can scale mountains

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,800
With boats, we can sail the seas

3
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:15,875
By age 40

4
00:00:16,076 --> 00:00:19,338
I had conquered every last domain

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,600
Pilos Peak alone defeated me...

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,875
As an adventurer

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,680
And well, maybe in other ways too

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,559
Now, I am approaching the end of my life

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,560
Many times I have sat

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,929
And stared up at that peak

11
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:43,500
As the boundless snow slowly engulfed me

12
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,450
It is a beast without weakness

13
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,462
The merciless face of the world

14
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:53,525
It fills me with fear...

15
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,877
And when an adventurer loses courage

16
00:00:56,877 --> 00:00:59,700
They can no longer climb mountains

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,275
My mountaineering days may be over

18
00:01:03,275 --> 00:01:06,080
But I have a greater ambition now

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,430
Humans create tools to conquer nature

20
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,275
And when nature conquers them in return

21
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:15,150
They create better tools

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,937
Where our legs cannot take us

23
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:19,716
Maybe our tools can

24
00:01:19,716 --> 00:01:21,825
And when tools fail us

25
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:25,100
Perhaps wings can carry us instead

26
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:29,980
My dear friend, I leave you my designs

27
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,584
For the "Wings of Incompletion"

28
00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:36,727
Against the unknown, humanity stands as one

29
00:01:36,727 --> 00:01:37,975
To be alive

30
00:01:37,975 --> 00:01:43,000
Is to seek, to set foot in every place that the eye can see

31
00:01:44,676 --> 00:01:47,286
I have little time remaining

32
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,961
Though the wind has not yet come for my soul

33
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,275
But between us

34
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:58,375
And your children, students, and friends

35
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:05,100
I believe that someone will reach that place at last
