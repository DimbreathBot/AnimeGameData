The peaceful sea surged, sending the ship sliding between the silent manor and the temple.
Under the pale moonlight, the golden dome that had seemed so glorious in the daytime lost its luster.

The God King awoke with a start from his majestic dream. The clear starlight had fled.
Violence and estrangement formed a darkness deeper than darkness, shrouding the great dome.
In terror and remorse did he summon to him his most loyal guards and most attuned musicians,
And he gave them his final orders, intending to bring peace back to the fractured lands...

Yet, just as a flood unleashed cannot be held back, the deeply ingrained arrogance and prejudice could not be reversed in a night, and crushed the Harmosts and rulers...
All the noble sacrifices, all the unselfish plans — all fell to ruin at the hands of the wicked, and all came crashing down in the end.
Whether the barbaric armies of the Fell Dragon Prince, or the God King determined to the last to save the empire,
They were swept away by an inexorable storm — even the luxurious palace and the jade-green manor were consigned to destruction together...
Without the guiding golden song, the once-noble people of the glorious kingdom transformed into disfigured golems...

When the final cacophony of the golden night faded to calm, the Harmost Boethius lay amidst the rubble,
Only the rubble heard his insensate mumblings, and only the debris recorded the sin of treachery...

"In a moment of madness, he betrayed us all."
"Order will not easily change, nor will human regrets."
