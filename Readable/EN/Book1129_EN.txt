According to the tales that circulate in Nasha Town today, the master thief once walked the world without a disguise, free and tall.
It was only after the cold gibbet in front of the royal court failed to take his life,
That he began wearing the silver mask that might have covered his handsome face forevermore,

"Like us, they couldn't even save themselves. All we could do was take pity on each other."

The thief who wore the silver mask held the gods in open contempt, scorning the empty fame that the nobles vied for so desperately.
To the taciturn thief, both the northland Tsar and the mistress of the Frost Moon deserved his contempt and silence equally.
Until that rush of moonlight poured from the high tower, incinerating both the silver and the resolve reflected in her eyes...
