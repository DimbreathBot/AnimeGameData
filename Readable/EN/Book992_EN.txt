(This sheet of paper has already gone yellow with age. The scribbled words on it read as follows...)
"Hollow" is the term that the scrolls, at least, use to describe this huge structure that surrounds the city.
But it seems evident from my investigation that these "hollows" actually precede Ochkanatlan itself.
Rather than say that these were built around Ochkanatlan to supply the city with energy...
One should say, instead, that Och-Kan piggybacked off these devices and built his new city atop the original one, which had been built by the ancient dragons...
This might also explain why the scale of the underground areas, and some of the surface ones too — such as the width of the roads, or the size of the buildings — are as they are, seeming to have been built for beings that dwarf the average human.
