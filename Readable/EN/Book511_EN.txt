...To Lord Hibehrous, General of the Cavalry,
After much deliberation, the Council of Nobles has decided to reject your request for funding...
It is apparent that the shrinking of the local oases and degradation of irrigation facilities has had no impact on overall agricultural production, and that any negative consequences can be resolved via the self-regulating nature of long-term commercial and industrial operations.
...Considering the long-term state of poverty and rebellion in Panjvahe, and the increased activity of the adherents of the "Brass Mask," the Treasury believes that any sort of monetary reward, industrial or commercial investment will prove futile, and indeed, will damage the interests of the nobility...

...Do recall, Sir General, that the noble estates are the pillars of the nation. Your duty is to put these rebels and heretics down with an iron fist and to spur the people unto hard work and prosperity... not to arbitrarily request funding with which to aid the indolent and the insurgent.

In the name of His Majesty, Parvezravan the Spirit of Victory, the Council of Nobles once again hereby transfers thirty riot control constructs and four hundred weapons of various types (swords, spears, crossbows among them) infused with Jinn fragments... to you, General Hibehrous, for your judicious use.
