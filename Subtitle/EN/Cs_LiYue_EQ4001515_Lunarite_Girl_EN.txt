1
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:08,753
Marchosius, God of the Stove, born from a spark when stone struck stone

2
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,018
He was a god with a great love for humanity

3
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:15,253
And their well-being

4
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:21,575
Millennia ago, the people sought to expand their city

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:26,500
They built a dwelling on the plains and called it the Guili Assembly

6
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,425
The Stove God cared greatly for the people

7
00:00:29,782 --> 00:00:35,300
Turning himself into minions who went into every home, fostering food and solidarity alike

8
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,300
Alas, their home was taken by a flood

9
00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:42,450
The waters ravaged the Guili Assembly

10
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,483
And forced the people back south, to Liyue Harbor

11
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:55,025
Though the distance was not far, the journey was plagued by a terrible storm

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,960
For a dozen days the adepti stayed by their side

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,625
During this time, the Stove God cooked an ancient delicacy

14
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:10,275
Flatbread with a meat sauce to stave off the cold and damp, fit for those on the move

15
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:19,475
Centuries later, disaster and plague arose once more

16
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,625
The Stove God would appear no longer

17
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:26,308
For he placed all of his power into the land itself

18
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:28,669
To quell the calamities

19
00:01:28,669 --> 00:01:32,100
His power expended, and his wits greatly reduced

20
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,575
Thus, his body decreased in size

21
00:01:34,864 --> 00:01:38,925
By the time he parted ways with us, he wasn't even the height of a human

22
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:44,925
He told Rex Lapis and I of the dishes that bring joy and of the secrets of the flame

23
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:46,955
Then went into the mountains

24
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:50,121
And entered into a long slumber

25
00:01:56,447 --> 00:01:59,350
The Stove God departed and Guoba was born

26
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,600
When he awoke, he ate the Chili-Mince Cornbread Buns

27
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,875
Placed on the offering table by a young lady in yellow

28
00:02:06,338 --> 00:02:10,000
Though he did not remember the past, he was profoundly moved

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,100
And decided to follow this young lady thereafter

30
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:16,300
The Stove God had quietly disappeared

31
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,722
But the vendors rose early to hawk their wares

32
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,626
People went out to buy goods, lit their stoves and cooked food

33
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,851
Just as they had done every day for as long as they could remember

34
00:02:29,706 --> 00:02:32,925
In Liyue, things have always been this way

35
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:47,050
Nature provides, the mountains rejoice, we are blessed by heaven's good grace

36
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,800
Years have gone by, the world has transformed, but our way of life survives

37
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:16,050
Fame and fortune, is only a season, it is the moment that we should embrace
