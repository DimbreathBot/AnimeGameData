"When demons sought the world in shadow to submerge, in time of need the Khvarena did emerge.
From the plane of light eternal, down to the darkness of death infernal.
The living deity first let the waters of Amrita flow, the merciful god replanted the tree of life to grow.
From two were Khvarena's children birthed, by holy three was all life delivered.
All knowledge from its flowers blooms,
All good spirits from its fruit are seeded.
Five kinds of songbirds by it be nourished, five kinds of poison roots by it be purged.
By it do we escape delusions and achieve purity, here we shall be its guardians in perpetuity.
Unto the magnificent eternal tree all our praises render, without equal is its glorious splendor!"
