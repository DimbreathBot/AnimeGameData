1
00:00:03,353 --> 00:00:04,135
Ah

2
00:00:04,585 --> 00:00:07,637
The hour of my execution is almost here

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,825
For the sinner

4
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:11,636
The curtain call has come

5
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:14,975
I know I may not sound it

6
00:00:15,023 --> 00:00:15,886
But...

7
00:00:16,073 --> 00:00:17,331
Faced with death

8
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:20,038
I find myself a little afraid

9
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:21,475
Perhaps

10
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:25,376
This is one thing both gods and humans have in common

11
00:00:29,898 --> 00:00:30,688
Hehe

12
00:00:31,946 --> 00:00:32,690
Farewell

13
00:00:32,745 --> 00:00:33,569
Neuvillette

14
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:38,241
I hope you've enjoyed the part you played these five hundred years

15
00:01:55,635 --> 00:01:57,696
Thank you, Furina

16
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:00,212
For all you've done

17
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:02,296
From this moment on

18
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,730
Please live happily as a human

19
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:07,610
Just as I wished we could

20
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,283
I, Iudex Neuvillette

21
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,113
Hereby declare...

22
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:35,384
People of Fontaine, your sins are forgiven
