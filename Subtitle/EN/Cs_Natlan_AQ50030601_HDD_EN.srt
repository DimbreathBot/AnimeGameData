1
00:00:03,025 --> 00:00:04,875
Archon, it's the Fatui!

2
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,503
The Archon of Natlan

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,471
A force to be reckoned with

4
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:28,825
The secret of the Ley Lines... is no secret to me

5
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:31,600
Long have they been destined for ruin

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,425
And since the oath made five centuries ago remains unfulfilled

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,075
What use is the Gnosis in your hands?

8
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:46,525
I don't know what you mean

9
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,174
But it sounds like this is about more than the Tsaritsa

10
00:00:51,075 --> 00:00:56,075
In times of crisis, someone must pick up the mantle of salvation

11
00:00:56,675 --> 00:00:58,750
Your plan has reached an impasse

12
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,850
And now it falls to me to create new "rules" for Natlan

13
00:01:03,975 --> 00:01:06,025
But before the dawn of a new age

14
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,725
The old must be destroyed

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,275
I assume that's the end of your speech

16
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:21,050
Good. People like us

17
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:23,535
Let our blades do the talking

18
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,900
Masters of the Night-Wind...?

19
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:47,450
Send word

20
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,400
The Captain and his followers must be apprehended
