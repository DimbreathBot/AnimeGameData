To Aderfi:
...If you see this letter, make haste to the designated coordinates to meet me. Do not forget to bring our contacts from the North...
...I should have rid us of that meddling blonde outsider by then...
...Ensure that the northerners endorse Jeht as our tribe's matriarch. For my part, I shall do all I can to convince her to marry me...
...Since Babel treats that traitor's daughter as the apple of her eye, and even wants her to inherit the tribe, let her taste the bitter fruit she has sown...
Once that happens, I shall revoke all the crimes that Babel has laid on your person, and pave the way for your next investment...
...I won't pursue the matter of your cooperation with the northerners. Just as Babel once secretly ordered, you will be our tribe's proxy for trade with them. I pledge not to rob or make secret moves against outsiders who have potential in matters of trade with us...
...Remember to make all haste! You must arrive before Babel discovers that we have been working together...
