In the era when the dark tide of filth arose from the sky's edge and heroes sun-bright marched forth to conquer,
Many stories transpired that were never recorded or eulogized in any human history.

When human warriors bid farewell to their secluded villages and brought blessings of the Wayob to once-inaccessible, forbidden realms,
The ancient dragons had become extinct from the fields they once ran upon, and the fruitful soil and springs had taken upon new colors.
The palaces and temples built upon magma cliffs lost their luster, now silently waiting for the judgment at the end of days,
In this dreamlike realm, cut off from the world, the end of the era of the ancients, too, drew nigh.
And in the lightless lands of night, the sacred ones continued their dissension over who would deliver this final verdict.

He was a hero unprophesied, a champion unaccounted for by any plan.
This was a time when the war chiefs of the tribes had abandoned their great cause of slaying wicked dragons, vying power-drunk for supremacy;
When their warriors plunged into endless warfare, leaning on savage beasts for support.
And in those days from the dark lands rose a king bright as the newborn sun, warm as the budding dawn.
He wore a crown woven from golden flowers, wielded a great blade of obsidian, and visited one tribe after another.

Disagreements born from blades can only be resolved by the blade, and delusion born from ambition can only be subdued by ambition still greater.
And the one who had thought itself master over evolution never imagined that those with strength would give it an answer beyond conquest and slaughter.
Under the sun's radiance did the tribes make a pact of armistice, and thus did the sacred ones of the night realm lay their arguments aside and offer him the crown.
The dawn of a new era emerged over the horizon, and when that light illuminated the earth, even the beasts of darkness had nowhere to hide.
