(This seems to be the diary of a soldier stationed here.)

I'm puzzled, to be honest. Why do we have to go to such lengths to capture Saurians from Natlan...
Something something phlogiston, special constitution, something something solid and liquid... Nomokonov seems more familiar with these things. I hear he had some kind of technical background before joining up with the Fatui.
He always tries to explain things to me, but it's all mumbo-jumbo to me. My brain just ain't cut out for that kinda stuff. The Fire-Water they sent us from Snezhnaya interests me more, anyway.
...
Our Lord has never revealed what all this phlogiston research is meant to be about.
That person from Natlan he brought with him the last couple of times seemed kinda suspicious, but we trust our Lord's judgment. Not like we care much about this stuff anyway...
First, a glass of Fire-Water, and then, sleep!

Note to self: Don't get locked inside next time.
I wish someone could've seen Vasily's face â€” he looked so pleased with himself, he did!
He's usually pretty likable, but so by-the-book when things need doing! Bo-ring.
Worse, there's no Fire-Water to drink today. Damn that Vasily, he took my stash!
