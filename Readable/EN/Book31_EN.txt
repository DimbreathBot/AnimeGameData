"I am the Prince of the Kingdom of Light from the other side of the world," the prince said to the shocked Princess.
The Prince shone with an extraordinary light. The people of the Moonlight Forest had never seen such vitality. For as the Prince strolled through the forest, life flourished around him: new leaves sprouted and the Princess and her people grew stronger.
He had come to save them. He would eventually save her from the darkness and take her to a kingdom free from all shadows. Although the Prince didn't say it explicitly, the Pale Princess had sensed the possibility of his arrival through her years of meditation.
So, she asked.
"What's the world like on the other side of the moon?"
The Prince had already told her about the Kingdom of Light hundreds of times before, but at that moment, the Prince realized that she was determined to find out for herself.
So, having sworn to save her people, the Princess and the Prince left the Moonlight Forest and walked hand in hand into the dark forest of the Land of Night.
