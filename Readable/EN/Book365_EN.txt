(An old notebook. Someone has written in it with neat handwriting.)
Now, you might find it strange that a notebook has been put in front of the door, yes? Well, I'd say it's more conspicuous that way.
I do hope you aren't flipping through this notebook as you walk into the room behind that door, because then there won't be anything I can do for you.
If you haven't entered yet, then definitely don't enter! It's a trap that locks you inside!
See the etchings at the entrance? They're markings left for us by a senior adventurer. It's the second time I've seen them, and judging from the handwriting, they must have been the work of the same person...
I haven't met this senior, but they've already saved me twice by my count.
Thank you so much, whoever you are!

Well, even if I was in the secret chamber, it surely would have been a cinch for someone as exceptionally clever as me to find their way out of it, but as they say, "truly smart adventurers never put themselves in real danger"...
So I shan't test my luck.

So, let me guess: you didn't notice the etchings, and my notebook saved you. Don't forget to thank me!
Hehe, I'll be going to the ruins up there next, so I can get a panoramic view of the sea. I'm sure it'll be a great view. Can't wait to brag about it to my friends if I do manage to see it.
