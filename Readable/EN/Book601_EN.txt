Ugh, why don't we have uniforms for desert climates? It's so hot, I'm dying.
All I see is sand, sand, and more sand! If only all this sand were snow.
I really want to just dive into the snow and have a nice cool swim.

The first thing I see when I wake up in the morning is Commander Markozov's face. I don't know how the man does it, but he inspects the various camps every day like clockwork.
And his breath when he speaks... It always smells like cheese, and no matter how many times I smell it, the stench doesn't get any better.
