Prayer Song XXI: Huurrekuutar, Goddess of the Frost Moon
O Huurrekuutar, mother of holy light, pray hear my pleas and cast your gaze from on high.
May your silent tears pierce the cold night, light a silver torch that never fades, and grant the people of the far north a guiding light.
O Huurrekuutar, mother of the silver shuttle, hearken to my prayer and clothe the heavens in gentle veils.
May your spun silver thread lead lost souls from the underworld's filth, that they may not lose their way in the cold night.
O Huurrekuutar, wherever you lead, we shall follow, and your will shall be our law.
Better that the cold night of death blind our sight, than that we sing in shame beneath a false light.

(Note from the Priestess Ehrnrooth: This is an older, unedited version of the prayer. It was originally brief, as the only matters too sacred to be spoken of at length were the chief god who protected our ancestors, and the origin, past, and future of the moons. The first Moonchanter, Aila, later revised and simplified the prayer's content. The following text is now recognized as the standard for all recitations:

O pale white Frost Moon, in the name of the descendants of the far north, I beseech you to cast down your gaze from the celestial dome above.
May your gentle tears pierce the frigid night, and grant us, the forsaken and forgotten, your guiding light.)

Prayer Song XXII: Kuutar, the Moon Maiden
O pure and flawless new moon, in the name of the messenger of the Frost Moon, I beg for your grace and mercy.
Cleanse us of our sins, I pray, and wipe away the endless pains and tears of those forever barred from Elysium.
