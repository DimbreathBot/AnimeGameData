O Nagarjuna,
Aided by Khvarena in its countless forms, I bless this land of eternal calamity.
When the sludge of the deepest depths of the abyss stained the first kingdom,
The glorious Khvarena that aided the Lord of Wisdom was scattered in endless forms.
I crossed back over the River of Sorrow, and of the Amrita I drank.
I opened a path for the benevolent spirits so that the merciful light of wisdom may illuminate the four corners.

O Nagarjuna,
Aided by Khvarena in its countless forms, I nourish the benevolent spirits in the sea of flowers.
Behold, soul illuminated by Khvarena, final descendant of the god of grass and trees.
Behold, heroes who battle the cataclysm endlessly, foes of the Dev.
For not even the inky gloom from beyond the skies shall erode their forms.

O Nagarjuna,
Aided by Khvarena in its countless forms, I have transcended the dead of this foul earth.
Cleanse the sinless of their sins, so that they may be reborn in a pure land free of suffering.
In the chakras of the earth are contained the karmic seeds that will give birth to all things.
The fleeting blights and glories of the earthly realm are naught but the illusion of existing seeds.

O Nagarjuna,
Aided by Khvarena in its countless forms, I have cleansed the abyss of heaven above.
The sludge welling up from the depths of the abyss has finally receded,
The legacy of Dahri, too, has submitted to the law.
A thousand songs were sung in unison, and the heavy rains abated for a time.

O Nagarjuna,
If the dark tide reappears and the black abyss returns,
Sing this hymn and offer prayers to the Khvarena unassailable.
May the eternal Khvarena guide us on the upward path.
