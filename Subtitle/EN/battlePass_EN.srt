00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:05,312
Once, there was a glorious kingdom established among the heavens

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:13,425
From that kingdom came a crowned heir, tasked with seeking out the Genesis Pearl from the Kingdom of Darkness

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,650
The first crowned heir began her journey of seeking the pearl

4
00:00:22,144 --> 00:00:26,825
But she was deceived, and the memory of her noble origins faded

5
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:31,400
She now believed that she was the queen of the Kingdom of Darkness

6
00:00:33,152 --> 00:00:39,700
But take heart, a second crowned heir had already taken up the path where the first had stumbled

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,500
This is the story of your journey, of your tale to be told
