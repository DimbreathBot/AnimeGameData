Guizhong's Four Commandments are: "Teach with wisdom, be bound by virtue, fortify the bones, unite in ambition â€” the convergence of these four shall be known as the 'Guili Assembly.'"
"...One can bear not to leave one's native land. A treasure lies in Guili, and Guizhong's Four Commandments shall guide those in generations to come who aspire to find it, if they would test themselves against the Four."
