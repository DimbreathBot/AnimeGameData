Thankfully, my fever had abated by this morning, otherwise I might have missed boarding the Fosegrin, and then what would I do!? How could my two little sweeties go travelling alone without their tutor's supervision? I'm still not sure how I caught that flu â€” I've always been meticulous about health and hygiene. Wouldn't do to infect the children, you understand.

Salomea's been in a foul mood all day, and she won't say why. When I was tucking her in at night, she covered her head with the blanket and turned her back to me with a harrumph. Is she mad at me? Or uneasy at being away from the comforts of home, I'll wager. Sweet little Salme, though, well, she's a different story. She apologized to me on behalf of her sister and told me not to take it to heart. As though I could! The only thing my heart has room for is love for these two children!

Just as I was about to close the door, Salme whispered, "Ms. Vedrana, can you promise me something?" Naturally, I accepted. For these two children who had left their home and their father to travel by themselves, I would promise them anything.
"Please go back to your cabin now, and promise me you won't set foot outside your room until the sun is up."

I hurriedly closed the door. I was so overcome with emotion that I nearly wept. Salme was worried about my health! As soon as I've finished writing in my diary, I'm going to do exactly as she says and sleep until sunrise.
