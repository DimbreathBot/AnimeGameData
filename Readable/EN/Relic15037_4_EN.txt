This flower, carved from flint and Drakite, was left in Cinder City. It is a talisman passed down through generations by beast tamers from the Scions of the Canopy.
A flint paw print adorns the item, said to have been made by the first Yumkasaurus to bond with a human.

The beast tamers are those who focus on building friendships with Saurians. Their ideals are sometimes incomprehensible even to their fellow tribespeople,
For they seek to settle matters peacefully even with violent Saurians who have hurt a human, even attempting to beat the Saurian Hunters to the punch.
"There is a way to gain the trust of even the most vicious Saurian â€” all that is needed is enough patience."
This was the wisdom the young beast tamer received from his master alongside this weighty talisman, and he kept it in his heart.
"Beasts, too, have the same hearts as we do." So he believed, and so kept faith, until the world-engulfing black tide came.

Those were monsters who could never be understood, beasts with whom peace could never be made.
When he finally returned to his hometown, all he saw were dreams ripped to shreds by monstrous claws running amok.
Settling the tribespeople fortunate enough to survive, the beast tamer, no longer young, embarked on a journey from which there could be no return.
This time, his foes were the heartless demons that came in with that dark tide, and dealing with them, too, required patience.
For only patience could ensure that not one of them was left to plague the land he held dear.

Legends hold that the ancient Python King once forged a secret, Abyss-repelling treasure that could only be retrieved from the filth-ridden ancient city.
Perhaps such was simply the wishful thinking of those who dwelled deep in despair, but for the brave, this hope was yet worth a try.
At the end of his journey, the warrior bereft of his home would reach the burned-out city, and there come face to face with a secret long buried.
