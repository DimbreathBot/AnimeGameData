(The perimeter of this Obelisk is adorned with gold leaf. Only a notable nation could have left such a relic behind.)
Muzaffar Dey once instructed the Verdant Lord Zumurud to leave as many heirs as a pomegranate tree bears fruits, so as to not have a repeat of the power vacuum that had followed the tragedy of King Saleb Dowleh.

And so the Verdant Lord had 99 sons and daughters, and there was not one realm throughout the land that had such great fortune as he.
Fifty of these were princes, and each wore a golden crown, and each was as valiant as a lion. Of them, the wisest was Muzzudin, whose stature was like that of a giant. In the name of the Verdant Lord's grand dream, he and his equally mighty brother Badanah, born as they were of the same mother, drove their slaves before them with sword and plow, planting trees in the desert and turning the barren soil into thriving forest.
The other 49 were princesses, each as lovely as the flowers beneath the moon, and each wore a garland made of green leaves. Each time even a single leaf should wither, a servant would pluck a new leaf and replace the wilted one, such that they should always appear as gentle and elegant as the vines. Of these princesses, the most lovely was Hanzada Sultan, whose nose was as high-flown as the sand dunes, and whose hair was as rich as the forest â€” indeed, her face seemed as if it were touched by the glory of moonlight itself.

They were skilled and elegant in speech, as if they were nobles under the rule of Al-Ahmar himself, and ordinary servants could never comprehend. As such, only the sons and daughters of the most loyal retainers could serve them.
The children of the Verdant Lord walked the land like gods, and the Verdant Lord's realm was as indestructible as the Mausoleum of King Deshret.
