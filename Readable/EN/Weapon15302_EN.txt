A long time ago, in a place far, far away... Tragedy struck.
Brothers took to arms against one another.
One among them was a great archer. After suffering a humiliating defeat, he made a vow:
"Until I have brought down my enemies,"
"Until I have pierced their throats and their blood has run dry, I shall not clean my feet."
And so, the great archer fell prey to a foot infection.
