That was the age when the banners of all the tribes had returned to the corroded ruins of the Cinder City, when oaths had long since faded away.
Having gradually fallen into delirium, the human king now babbled of his crazed obsessions, his eyes reflecting naught but fear.
Though still given to lament how the grand vision he had once held — of humans and dragons coexisting — was now beyond reach,
Yet the aging hero could not bring himself to rebel against his only surviving friend of old.

In the end, he thought, the color would thus fade from all verdant paths.
In this way, passion is just like fire — despite regret and unwillingness, once extinguished, it is gone.
Just as there was no such thing as a flame that could itself be rekindled, so there would never be a path that was his, and his alone.
And thus, the disheartened old man silently accepted the idle position of ordnance officer for the Grand Alliance,
Resolving never to interfere with his old friend's orders again, waiting only for the day that he would return to the Sacred Flame...

Until, having saved the dragons from the shadow of the sword, alone at night came the scarlet-eyed youth to pay a visit to the ordnance officer's abode,
With that zeal, at once both strange and familiar, he pleaded with the old hero to break the chains of the broken oath.

Steadfast and taciturn, the old man did not answer him directly, only glancing at the dusty greatsword beside him.
In his eyes, over the long years glazed dull with gloom, a spark of fiery brilliance flashed up once more.
