Act I
Cast: Kurotani Seishimaru ({NICKNAME}), Wakayama Keisuke (Sasano), Yano Machiko (Koharu)
Inside a restaurant that Seishimaru and Keisuke frequent.

Wakayama Keisuke: It's been a while, Seishimaru.
Wakayama Keisuke: I've heard that you're in charge of the Kurotani Clan's affairs now.
Wakayama Keisuke: Looks like the dust has settled since that incident.
Wakayama Keisuke: Lord and Lady Kurotani are gone...
Wakayama Keisuke: But you're taking up the mantle as their eldest {M#son}{F#daughter} to continue to serve the public.
Wakayama Keisuke: I'm sure they would be pleased.
Kurotani Seishimaru: <color=#00E1FFFF>Can the dust settle before vengeance is had?</color>
Wakayama Keisuke: You? You want to take revenge?
Wakayama Keisuke: We're not children anymore, how can you still be just as impulsive as you were back then?
Wakayama Keisuke: *sigh* With Lord Kurotani's abilities, the investigation never should have gone as wrong as it did.
Wakayama Keisuke: But he said himself that he was willing to accept the blame and punishment.
Wakayama Keisuke: The punishment from the great lords was indeed harsh...
Wakayama Keisuke: But Lord Kurotani asked for it himself. I fear that there is still much left unsaid here.
Wakayama Keisuke: Kurotani and Wakayama are both reputable clans.
Wakayama Keisuke: You now carry the clan name. You're a samurai in service of the public, not some wandering Nobushi ronin.
Wakayama Keisuke: So no matter how angry you are, you must be patient right now. You mustn't seek revenge.
Kurotani Seishimaru: What's suspicious is some of the great lords' men!
Kurotani Seishimaru: They've been mighty pleased with themselves since my father's death.
Wakayama Keisuke: That's your anger clouding your judgment. They didn't necessarily have anything to do with it. Calm down!
Seishimaru looks out the door.
Kurotani Seishimaru: <color=#00E1FFFF>Whoever's eavesdropping outside, come on in.</color>
Wakayama Keisuke: Who are you? Who sent you to listen in on our conversation?
Machiko shows herself.
Yano Machiko: M—My apologies, good samurai, I—I'm just a tea seller, and my name is Machiko.
Yano Machiko: It wasn't my intention to eavesdrop.
Yano Machiko: Seishimaru saved my life yesterday, and {M#he}{F#she} didn't ask for rice or money.
Yano Machiko: I just wanted to repay {M#him}{F#her} and then go back to selling my tea. I didn't mean any offense, honest!
Keisuke looks at Seishimaru. Seishimaru nods.
Wakayama Keisuke: You... Forget it, it's to be expected that a mere tea vendor wouldn't know proper etiquette.
Wakayama Keisuke: Still, remember to address {M#him}{F#her} as "Master Kurotani" from now on.
Wakayama Keisuke: You know what? This is quite opportune. The Kurotani Clan needs people, after all.
Wakayama Keisuke: Why don't you stop selling tea and go with Master Kurotani?
Yano Machiko: I don't wish to call {M#him}{F#her} Master Kurotani. Seishimaru has a better ring to it.
Yano Machiko: And well, if I can get my fill of food, then sure! I'll follow Seishimaru.
Wakayama Keisuke: ...Do whatever you like. Seishimaru, Lord Kurotani is gone...
Wakayama Keisuke: You're in charge of things now. Don't do anything foolish.
Wakayama Keisuke: If you let your temper get the better of you... *sigh* Anyway, what's important is that your family name continues.
Kurotani Seishimaru: <color=#00E1FFFF>It wasn't your adoptive parents who died.</color>
Wakayama Keisuke: ...Seriously? Has anything I've said made it through that thick skull of yours?
Wakayama Keisuke: Let me ask you this. Will you really raise your blade against the great lords' men without a care for your clan!?
Wakayama Keisuke: Do you really wish to bring shame to your lord and disaster upon your family?
Seishimaru remains silent.
Wakayama Keisuke: Oh, great. This is just great! So no one shall have peace until your rage dissipates, yes?
Wakayama Keisuke: Well, since all my efforts to persuade you otherwise have been ineffective, then let me give you the truth straight out.
Wakayama Keisuke: Now, I've been the head of the Wakayama Clan since my father passed away.
Wakayama Keisuke: He served as Lord Kurotani's executioner.
Wakayama Keisuke: I know very well that he wronged your family and did great hurt to its name.
Wakayama Keisuke: And the execution was a matter of business, yes. But you're still my friend, and I still want to look after your family if at all possible...
Wakayama Keisuke: So, if you still want revenge, I fear I must say that my father is already dead.
Wakayama Keisuke: Come on then, punish me for his sins instead. I dare you.
Wakayama Keisuke: What? Are you hesitating because we are friends?
Wakayama Keisuke: Is that the extent of your resolve? Really? You can't even cut ties with me!
Kurotani Seishimaru: I was adopted anyway. The family name means nothing to me.
Kurotani Seishimaru: Besides, is the good standing of the "Kurotani" name really more important than my parents' lives?
Kurotani Seishimaru: Well, I'll show you my resolve. Draw your weapon!
Kurotani Seishimaru: Put it and that Temari over there on the table.
Seishimaru closes {M#his}{F#her} eyes.
Kurotani Seishimaru: I'll close my eyes until you've placed them. Then, I'll extend a finger.
Kurotani Seishimaru: If I point at your sword, then we must face each other in battle. If I point at the Temari, then we will sever all the bonds that lie between us.
Kurotani Seishimaru: Let us leave this to fate.
Wakayama Keisuke: Hmph, so be it. We're all set.
The sword is on Seishimaru's left and the Temari is on {M#his}{F#her} right. Eyes closed, Seishimaru <color=#00E1FFFF>points to the left</color> and then opens {M#his}{F#her} eyes.
Kurotani Seishimaru: It looks like our destiny has been decided. My life shall be devoted to vengeance. There shall be no rest till one of us is dead.
Wakayama Keisuke: Since you've made up your mind, then I must man up as well.
Wakayama Keisuke: I'll carry everything I said before through to the end. I'll be waiting for you.
Wakayama Keisuke leaves.

Act II
Cast: Kurotani Seishimaru ({NICKNAME}), Yano Machiko (Koharu), several Nobushi (extras)
Outside, in the overgrown wilderness.

A fight erupts between Seishimaru and the Nobushi, with the former ultimately emerging victorious.
Yamada Hifumi: I told you to get your coin pouch out, but you wouldn't listen! Come, my brothers, get him!
Tanaka: Hehe, you asked for this.
Yamamoto: This one's kinda... tough, boss! I... I can't beat him.

Yano Machiko: Master Seishimaru, Master Seishimaru! I was just out buying onigiri, and you're already in another fight?
Yano Machiko: If you need something, just give the order and I'll do it. There's no need for sword fights.
Yamada Hifumi: Have mercy, good samurai! We don't want your money anymore, please forgive us!
Yano Machiko: Please, enough. You'd even save someone like me, who was caught stealing rice...
Yano Machiko: You're not the sort of person who would so casually take a life.

Act III, Scene I
Cast: Kurotani Seishimaru ({NICKNAME}), Yano Machiko (Koharu), Wakayama Kojuurou (Sasano)
Outside, in the overgrown wilderness.

Yano Machiko: Master Seishimaru, I've found you someone from the Wakayama Clan.
Yano Machiko: But Master Keisuke is already... gone. Please, let this all go.
Wakayama Kojuurou: Hmph. So, Kurotani, you must have come for revenge on my brother.
Wakayama Kojuurou: Now listen here. Keisuke worked himself to the bone day and night to settle the clan's affairs this entire year...
Wakayama Kojuurou: And it was all because of your stupid agreement.
Kurotani Seishimaru: <color=#00E1FFFF>So he's gone.</color>
Wakayama Kojuurou: You're a coward for placing sole blame on your father's executioner!
Wakayama Kojuurou: And you won't get your revenge now, no matter how much you want it.
Wakayama Kojuurou: You know why? That's because our father's already gone.
Wakayama Kojuurou: Kurotani, you didn't have what it took to avenge your adoptive parents, and you wound up hurting Keisuke as well.
Wakayama Kojuurou: You don't deserve to be called a samurai.
Wakayama Kojuurou: Keisuke once said that executioners must be prepared to suffer retaliation.
Wakayama Kojuurou: If you can't even stomach that, then you can forget about charging into battle and taking the lives of others.
Wakayama Kojuurou: Since Keisuke isn't here anymore, then I, his younger brother Wakayama Kojuurou, am willing to take his place.
Kurotani Seishimaru: <color=#00E1FFFF>I'm sorry, I...</color>
Wakayama Kojuurou: It's too late for you to flee now. My brother died because of you, and I'll never forgive you or let you go!
Kojuurou raises his spear, and Seishimaru has no choice but to fight him.

Scene II

Kojuurou fights Seishimaru as hard as he can, but Seishimaru wins easily.
Wakayama Kojuurou: This is for Keisuke!
Yano Machiko: You're unbelievable. Why are you fighting again? You're both sensible adults, so why are you behaving like children?

Scene III

Kojuurou is defeated and exhausted.
Wakayama Kojuurou: As long as you don't kill me, I'll devote my life to seeking revenge, and I won't rest until one of us is dead.
Kurotani Seishimaru: <color=#00E1FFFF>I said the same thing once before.</color>
Yano Machiko: Well, it's fortunate that no one died. Just give it a rest, both of you!
Yano Machiko: Look at this fuss you're both making...
Yano Machiko: Clan this, revenge that — what about these vague notions is worth all this trouble anyway?
Yano Machiko: Look. I just sell tea. As long as I can eat my fill, I'm happy. I couldn't care less what my last name is!
Yano Machiko: I don't have much of a way with words...
Yano Machiko: But rain falls into the lake, the lake water evaporates, and rain falls from the sky again.
Yano Machiko: Even if that rain water freezes, it will become sweet tea if you heat it over a stove.
Yano Machiko: Who cares whether the tea you were served came from the sky, the lake, or the pot?
Yano Machiko: Um... This might sound like sophistry, I know.
Yano Machiko: But I'm telling you both to stop this fighting now and so you can go home to eat.
Kurotani Seishimaru: <color=#00E1FFFF>I really like you, Machiko.</color>
Yano Machiko: Huh? Why would you say that at a time like this? You're embarrassing me...
Yano Machiko: Good grief... Well, I'll just assume you won't fight with Sir Wakayama anymore, then.
Yano Machiko: Turn back, he can't move right now anyway.
Kurotani Seishimaru: Since my life is like rain and my death is like tea, both are like water. There is no point clinging on to things like this.
Yano Machiko: Yes, that's right, good!
Kurotani Seishimaru: If rains from the heavens can save the earth from calamity, then surely I can too, right?
Seishimaru jumps from the cliff.
Yano Machiko: Master!
Wakayama Kojuurou: Kurotani!
Ending Image: A Temari by the cliff.
The End.
