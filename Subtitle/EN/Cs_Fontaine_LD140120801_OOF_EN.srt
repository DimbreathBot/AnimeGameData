1
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:09,171
Is she here yet?

2
00:00:10,034 --> 00:00:11,356
When will she get here?

3
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:14,108
She's not coming!

4
00:00:14,156 --> 00:00:15,319
You're wrong...

5
00:00:16,052 --> 00:00:17,553
She's here

6
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:28,658
O, if I become one with the springs

7
00:00:28,784 --> 00:00:32,830
Can the world's wonder be restored?

8
00:00:32,986 --> 00:00:38,598
And will you forgive us our sins, dear mother?

9
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:46,048
The water's flow puts the dance in our step

10
00:00:46,318 --> 00:00:50,246
It nurtures our city

11
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:56,653
And thee, my beloved

12
00:00:58,313 --> 00:00:59,946
But what about your wish!?

13
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:01,652
My...

14
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:03,871
Wish?

15
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:13,905
If you become human...

16
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:16,504
You can reveal your secret to no one

17
00:01:16,983 --> 00:01:18,278
You will face suffering...

18
00:01:18,343 --> 00:01:19,608
And loneliness

19
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,249
Is this truly what you want?

20
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,631
If only true love were enough

21
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:35,346
But alas, I must bid thee adieu

22
00:01:35,503 --> 00:01:41,528
Our love but a bittersweet fairytale

23
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:46,896
Yet I am here, and here I shall remain

24
00:01:47,062 --> 00:01:52,278
To behold the world in all its beauty

25
00:01:52,768 --> 00:01:59,109
Until the end of time
