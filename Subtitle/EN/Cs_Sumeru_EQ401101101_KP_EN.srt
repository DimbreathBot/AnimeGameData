00:00:01,815 --> 00:00:05,079
My dear friend, you must be wondering

2
00:00:05,847 --> 00:00:08,043
Why I'm leaving you a letter like this

3
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:10,750
It's because...

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,200
Hey, Gulab! I'm here. How are you feeling today?

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,367
I gotta tell you, I had an idea for another card last night

6
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:21,095
Huh? What's that you're writing?

7
00:00:22,087 --> 00:00:24,164
Haha, it's nothing

8
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:29,882
Okay... Anyway, up for a game?

9
00:00:33,317 --> 00:00:38,203
You don't have to visit every day, you know. You should be focusing on your work at the Akademiya...

10
00:00:38,753 --> 00:00:42,031
Hey, enough of that, I'll keep visiting until you've fully recovered

11
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:46,428
Besides, I can't stand most of the folks at the Akademiya anyway!

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,095
Hey, it's your turn

13
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:53,025
*coughing*

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,087
Gulab!? Are you okay?

15
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:01,999
*cough* Garvipidam, you must understand...

16
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:03,508
My Eleazar...

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,817
Hey! Don't talk like that!

18
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:08,982
You just need some more rest...

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,012
*sigh*...

20
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:21,436
It's because... you won't come to terms with the fact that I don't have long left

21
00:01:23,725 --> 00:01:26,683
Guess what? This game we invented

22
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:29,475
Is getting pretty popular here in the hospital

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,299
Really? That's great news!

24
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:35,595
Yeah. I've even made a device

25
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,283
To help people find other players nearby

26
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,487
Here, this one's for you

27
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,950
This way, you'll be able to keep playing even after I'mâ€”

28
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,925
Just stop!

29
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:51,557
You're gonna get better, you hear me? I don't need this thing... I don't want it!

30
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,550
I imagine the Casket of Tomes I gave you

31
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,075
Is probably gathering dust in a corner somewhere...

32
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:06,649
So, this is my last gift to you. I'm sorry that I could only give it to you now

33
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:11,041
Do you remember when we first met?

34
00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:16,088
You were the only one willing to be friends with the kid with Eleazar

35
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,691
Now it's my turn to help you make some new friends

36
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:30,089
This way, I'll always be by your side, my friend
