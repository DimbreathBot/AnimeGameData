Letter 3: This is the tenth day or more that we've been separated from Boyang, the yaksha, and the others. Well, that's what I say, anyway. My friend here says that it's only been three days. I have no clue who is right or wrong, nor do I think that arguing serves any purpose at this point. I wish we could go home, but we cannot.
