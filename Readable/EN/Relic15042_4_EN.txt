That was a time when the gentle frost-light still lingered, a silver mirror unbroken, even as the golden realm had already fallen.
In a single night, the glorious golden tower fell like a fig tree. Across the frozen northern plain,
From the holy citadel to the ancient capital, dark blue crystal nails annihilated every last city with even the most minuscule sign of life.
The once-praised apostle and the gods' first messenger both vanished in the catastrophe.
Those who survived by grace of being nowhere near the cities at the time could only cling to life amidst the freezing wind and snow.
With no refuge left to them, they simply waited for destruction to find them in the hollow dark.

This is the great extinction spoken of in later prayers. Halcyon prosperity turned to dust,
And the gods remained silent, unmoved by cries, curses, or reproach.
In the despair of that long night, only one celestial ruler shed tears for the mortals' pain.
She was the mistress of the Frost Moon, queen of the celestial chariot and of light, a heavenly agent whose origin was one with that of the world.
Moved by pity, and a deeper, unspoken wish, she heeded the survivors' prayers.

According to legend, she spun gleaming threads from the silver glow to lead the displaced across the frozen plains.
And where her tears, full of longing, fell upon the frost-covered soil of the far north, they blossomed into lilies that would stand eternal in the icy winds.
The proud descendants of Hyperborea call themselves the "Frostmoon Scions" for this reason,
To honor the divinity who, whatever her original intent, gave them a new lease on life.
