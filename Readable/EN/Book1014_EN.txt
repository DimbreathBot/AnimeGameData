This tapestry is said to have been woven by Sanhaj Kompore, a hero of the Masters of the Night-Wind. Its contents are brief and bizarre, often dismissed as a joke by the elder shamans â€” and just like the countless jests this cunning hero told throughout his life, this one's colors carry a hint of moonlit darkness. Some say it was due to the threads he used, while others claim he ground obsidian and black-colored mussel shells into powder to achieve this touch of divinity.
Long, long ago, there was a cunning rogue amongst the Masters of the Night-Wind named Kompore. He was skilled in deception and theft, gaining advantage by both cunning and force, and thus was notorious within the tribe, but he had an honest brother named Sanhaj.
In that ancient time, the Lord of the Crossroads still walked among mortals, bestowing the grace of sleep or death upon the six tribes' people, guiding them along the path to the netherworld, and merging their souls into the great black river. He was master of the Night Realm, both "Papa Witch Doctor" and "Mama Dream-Realm." Legends speak of him building a small brewery at the end of the great black river, where he could reveal the fate of any person in dreams by drinking the mushroom wine brewed there.
"If I had this ability, would I not become like the prophets of our tribe, able to predict fate and uncover the truth that lies beneath this world?"
The rogue's eyes roved about, and he thought to himself again,
"And if that were the case, how much profit could secret knowledge and forbidden dreams bring me? What could I use such treasures to negotiate for?"
The cunning Kompore rubbed his palms, and thus began his crafty scheme.
