Hmph. You've gone down a bad path, Curve.
Secretly learning to lie without telling us is one thing, but to then immediately turn around and trick us? Are we even friends anymore?
Today, I'm making sure you get yours. Let's see how you like this trial of strength!
You owe us. You learned to lie thanks to us (that's what {NICKNAME} and Paimon said), so show some gratitude.
On the other hand, I suppose I should also thank you lot. I don't think I hate liars as much as I did before spending time with you.
Just as you said â€” liars come in all forms.
People lie for the sake of face, children, family, and gain, to comfort others, to protect others...
Tangled lies weave the great web in which people live their lives, right?
Still, I don't think Dr. Mosso was right when he said that "a curve is the shortest distance between two people."
There are definitely some times when you should just shoot your shot straight.
For example, I miss you.
