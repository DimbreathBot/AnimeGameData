Deep in the abyss, where celestial bodies cast no light,
the Bloodstained Knight kept this timepiece, though time had lost all meaning.

At an end was the Bloodstained Knight's story,
for he realized there was no place for him on this earth.
He ventured into the fallen ancient kingdom, and died in battle in the monsters' lair.
At the bottom of the world, he learned the origin of the monsters that destroyed the ancient kingdom.

"The ancient kingdom was wrongfully cursed,"
"Turning its inhabitants into monsters."
"The code of chivalry tolerates not such injustice."
"If Abyss be thy name, I pledge to you my loyalty."
