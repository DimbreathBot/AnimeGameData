—Modest Fortune—
A gust of wind suddenly whistles through the clear skies. What might this mean?
Though you may feel like you're just spinning your wheels, this is only temporary.
Look out for those who appear around you, familiar though those faces may be.
Who knows? Your fate may be changed by their presence without your knowledge...

Your lucky object for the day: A dandelion from a faraway land.
Seeds that follow the wind are a most fitting symbol for you.
Fly, drift, across the seas, to lands far away.
But one day, you will no longer drift.
One day, you will become what you hope to be.
