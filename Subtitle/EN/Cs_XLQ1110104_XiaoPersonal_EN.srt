1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,825
In ancient times, Liyue was a land of misery, where the shadow of evil loomed large

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,525
As slain gods festered

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:15,196
Their vengeful wrath cursed the world, manifesting in infernal forms

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,550
When demons stirred

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,150
Miasmas, monsters, and mutations infested the land

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:28,965
Then, Rex Lapis summoned the Yakshas to vanquish the demons

7
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:33,804
They swore an oath: "Restore order through slaughter"

8
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:38,313
"Purge evil through battle, to this we dedicate our lives"

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,073
Eons of bloodshed later

10
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:46,198
Karmic debt weighed upon them, phantom wrath seeping into their broken souls

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,925
They went mad with fear

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,200
Turned on each other

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,907
Or succumbed to the darkness

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,350
Of the five foremost Yakshas

15
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,550
Death came to three, while the fourth vanished without a trace

16
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,650
In the millennia since

17
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,075
One Conqueror of Demons remains the sole surviving Yaksha in the mortal realm

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,125
And only on moonlit nights

19
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:17,850
In the glow from Guyun and in the sound of the Dihua flute

20
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:20,100
Is his memory preserved
