1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,352
A long, long time ago, in a village lost to time

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,350
There lived a crimson oni and a blue oni

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,150
They were the best of friends

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,525
The crimson oni wanted to be friends with the humans

5
00:00:13,525 --> 00:00:16,200
So the blue oni played the role of the naughty kid...

6
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:20,225
And then he left

7
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:28,424
After a long time, the crimson oni was living happily with the humans

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,040
But in his heart, he wanted to bring the blue oni back home

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,026
The crimson oni didn't know where to find the blue oni

10
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,350
His search took him up the highest mountains

11
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:46,470
And across the widest rivers

12
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,925
He found many traces of the blue oni

13
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:55,204
But the more he found, the clearer it became:

14
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:58,469
The blue oni was hiding on purpose

15
00:01:01,225 --> 00:01:06,384
So just as the blue oni had once done, the crimson oni left him a letter:

16
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:11,643
"Dear Ao, I've made lots of human friends now"

17
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,971
"And I wanna have a big party for everyone"

18
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:19,963
"I want all my friends to be there. That means you too, Ao"

19
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,034
"If you don't wanna meet me, you can just watch from a distance"

20
00:01:26,427 --> 00:01:30,743
The blue oni snuck back to the village, and hid in the shadows

21
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:36,242
He saw the great feast and roaring fire, and longed to join in

22
00:01:37,625 --> 00:01:39,350
But though his stomach rumbled

23
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:44,300
The blue oni remembered the oath of old, and kept his distance

24
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,725
Suddenly, he jumped: The crimson oni was right behind him!

25
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,625
"Hey, you're finally back!"

26
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,195
"C'mon, I'll introduce you!"

27
00:01:59,425 --> 00:02:01,400
"It's time everyone met my best friend"
