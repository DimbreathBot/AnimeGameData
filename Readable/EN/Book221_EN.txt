—Misfortune—
It seems like it will rain today. You may encounter an unpleasant situation.
You will still be waiting for the commendation you are due, and you may be served the wrong dish by the waiting staff.
Nothing terrible happens, but everything seems to irritate you.
It's just one of those days.

Your lucky object for the day: Drifting Seagrass
Seagrass is a gentle but tenacious plant.
Despite the bitterness of the seawater around it, it refuses to change.
Hold onto your gentle nature, even when nothing is going your way.
