1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,079
They're here

2
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:09,719
Just like I said

3
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:10,840
What happâ€” Aah!

4
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,519
You're just in time

5
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:21,679
But... be ready to run

6
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:51,119
Yes!

7
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:11,880
Three

8
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,000
Two...

9
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:14,000
...One

10
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,719
This won't hold it for long

11
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,360
Find Neuvillette. Tell him the defenses are about to collapse

12
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,280
Then what would happen to you?

13
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,719
Until he arrives

14
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:43,559
We're the last line of defense

15
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,719
The gate... How long do you think it'll hold?

16
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,119
That depends on us
