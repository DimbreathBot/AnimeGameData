The consequences of the phlogiston theft worsen by the day. Most of the other rulers allow humans to use phlogiston to kill and conquer each other, some even encouraging them to commit more atrocities. They seem to see this as an effective means of controlling the human population... or perhaps they derive mere amusement from it.

The flood of refugees surging northward grows ever larger, and the tidings they bring grow ever more horrifying. The chieftain of Kacho'pinik offered his daughter in marriage to the leader of the Culhua, hoping to win their allegiance. Yet the Culhua instead cut out her (...), sacrificed her to (...), and marched (...) upon their villages, for their food stores were more abundant. They do not understand how we extract vitality from blood, yet they ape our ways nonetheless, offering up meaningless slaughter to their imagined gods.

I spoke with Kemonel. Even she felt a pang of reluctance, though her pity was not for humans, but for her own kin, now reduced to mere beasts. More and more humans have begun taming vishaps, turning them into tools of slaughter, for even stripped of their intellect, their claws and fangs still rend flesh with ease. Thus, Kemonel has sought to ally with those humans who yearned for peace, hoping to harness their souls to weave an eternal, blissful dream-realm for the dragons of her domain. Even the unfortunate fallen might shed the forms that imprison them and find happiness and solace within this dream.

It is not an unfeasible plan, but her approach would inevitably weaken oversight of human settlements, inviting greater suffering upon these frail creatures who have come from beyond the skies.

The sorrow of humankind stems from their lack of hierarchy. Dragons are born to submit to their superiors and command their inferiors. Even if I appeared before them in human guise, they would instantly catch my scent, recognize my station, and obey my orders — for it is the law carved into their blood, their path ordained by nature, for the weak to revere the strong, offspring to follow their sire, and subjects to serve their sovereign. But humans are different. Humans are born to deceive their betters, torment weaker kin, and even betray entire clans — or slaughter the very blood that gave them life — for nothing but selfish gain. Their eyes reflect no path that belongs to them, or if they did, they shall doubtless invent endless excuses to forsake said path. Without proper guidance and restraint, they repeat the same atrocities, never learning from their past misdeeds.

All defilement of life is blasphemy, an unforgivable stain upon our Sovereign's honor. Thus, only by elevating humans to stand on equal footing with dragons, forcing them to learn the necessity of the weak kneeling to the strong, and the meaning of their ordained path, can their capacity for violence be utterly purged.

...It is an idea that has yet to come to pass. If the reaver from beyond the sky can seal off an entire planet to force humanity into their imposed order, then why might I not seal off my domain in turn? Let it become an impervious refuge. Let nothing within depart, and nothing without enter. A closed, ordered system, where life's future may be sculpted without flaw...

Let this plan be named "Xibalba," a title borrowed from the humans of my domain, their primitive myths whispering of an underworld. Should it succeed, neither the sovereign rulers nor the Abyssal foe shall be able to breach its sealed laws. A fitting title for an incorruptible sanctuary...

The king's waking days grow rarer, and so too do our chances to commune with him. He approved Kemonel's plan, as well as my own.

Like Kukulkan, I grow perplexed... What path may bring true joy to our Sovereign? What kind of path may allow this land to prosper for ten thousand years to come?

I do not know. The Xibalba project is progressing smoothly, but even if it were progressing perfectly, I could not convince myself. If the hierarchy of power has failed to ease our Sovereign's suffering... If I cannot, by the wisdom he granted me, fathom how to truly please him... Then by what right do I dare ordain a path for all other lives?

Perhaps... I need to observe the humans more, humans who have yet to be tainted by their laughable traditions. If there truly is still hope, then...
