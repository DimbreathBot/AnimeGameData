...Anyway, when it comes down to it, our research directions are different, so I applied for a new research lab with the director. But there's nothing for it anyway. Alain is incredibly intelligent, but he only trusts himself, and doesn't trust our observations or accomplishments unless he reaches the same conclusions through his own calculations. Well, it's okay, since Alain is making the world a better place in his own way. I trust him, because this is the world that Ann lives in...
...Even though the Institute is full of people, I don't have many friends besides Carter. It feels like everyone kinda dislikes us...
...Rene managed to acquire something powerful to research. Apparently these appeared after the disaster, and are very dangerous for most people. But I feel okay, maybe my constitution really has gotten a lot better...

...I helped Rene out!

...When I visited him, I found out that he also attended Narzissenkreuz Institute. We didn't tell him about the Vice Director abandoning us, or it would have made him sad... If only we could have helped him just like I was helped...

...After discussing it with Rene, he finally agreed to give it a try. He said since it's dangerous everything needs to be made clear to Carter and he must make the judgment himself as it concerns his own life. But, if it's successful, then he'll survive just like I did...
