A beautiful top hat untouched by time.
Listening closely, one can almost hear an ancient tune echoing inside the hat.

Thousands of years ago, a troupe wandered through the lands.
The troupe owned not a single shred of sheet music. What they saw was what they sung, and what they heard was what they played.
As time passed, the troupe gradually realized the vastness of the world.

"There are so many things in the world for us to sing of."

The members then turned the notes into words and recorded their journey in a book.
This book, The Widsith as they called it, was still held tightly in the conductor's hands even after his death.
