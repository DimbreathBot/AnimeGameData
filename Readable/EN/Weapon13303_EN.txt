One night, a Millelith officer drank with a poet, and brought his signature white-tasseled halberd with him.
The poet's ink was spilled.
And the halberd's white tassel was dyed black.
"'Tis but a tale of polearm wielder and poet."
"Unrelated to mine own black-tasseled polearm."
The old smith smacked his apprentice.
He demanded that he dye the newly made polearm's tassel black.
