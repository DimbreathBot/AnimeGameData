Prelude
Outside in the quiet countryside.
In the verdant wilds of Narukami, Haru and Sasano stand back to back, each speaking with their eyes closed.
Sasano: The wind is coming.
Haru: Where from?
Sasano: Don't worry about where it's coming from, all you need to know is that it's coming for them.
Haru: Where are they?
Sasano: That outlander? They're already walking the path to death.
Sasano opens his eyes, then walks into the distance holding Haru's hand.

Act I, Scene II
Outside in the quiet countryside.
The outlander and the two are besieged by the enemy. After escaping with great difficulty, they arrive in the countryside, wounded. (The outlander isn't bleeding)
Sasano: This won't do. If this continues, we won't have a chance against them.
Haru: We'll have to sacrifice ourselves.
The two rush out of the frame.
Outlander: <color=#00E1FFFF>How did this happen?</color>
The outlander wears a pained expression, but soon makes up their mind again.
Outlander: <color=#00E1FFFF>But I won't lose like this.</color> (Close-Up)
Outlander: <color=#00E1FFFF>Don't underestimate my resolve!</color> (Super Close-Up)
The outlander turns and walks back towards the enemy ranks as the screen fades to black. Next scene.

Act I, Scene III
Outdoors, the enemy stronghold.
After making up their mind, the outlander cuts their way to the enemy stronghold.
Haru: (Desperately) Don't worry about us!
Sasano: (Impatiently and loudly) Hurry, go on without us!
The outlander spins around, continuously swinging their weapon. Through this endless rotation, this warrior becomes a golden whirlwind! The golden whirlwind covers every inch of the frame.
Each enemy caught in the golden whirlwind's endless attacks suffers pain immeasurably worse than that of tooth decay!
The golden whirlwind rapidly flings all enemies on screen into the distance, where they land hard on the ground!
The outlander finally reaches the imprisoned Sasano and Haru, freeing them.
