Barrow and his wife swore to travel around Fontaine and spent their entire lives on the road.
They had a daughter, Penny, a lovely girl who loved swimming and fish.
They left her with their best friend, Rouge, to spare her the disruption and rootlessness.

Barrow also wishes the reader of this letter that happiness. Why not go and find the surprise he has hidden for you?
