That "senior scholar" fell and hurt himself. Typical of someone from the Rtawahist â€” always gazing skyward and never at their feet. I'm guessing the Obscuring Cell must've been one of King Deshret's prized creations, judging by how many of them there are around here.
Thankfully, the injury was limited to a few scrapes and a mild dislocation. After I popped the bone back into place, I had him lie down and rest. This whole thing will set us back a while, but perhaps that's not such a bad thing. For those like him who lack the skills, doing nothing might be the best contribution they can make.
As I was treating him, he brought up that tired old topic, asking me to join the Darshan. Once more, I firmly refused. Mediocre students find safety in confining themselves to a single field. But what good would that do me?
It's only been a few days, but I've already made significant progress. There are numerous writings here about the Seven Pillars, each one captivating and exciting in its depth and detail.
Now that the senior is no longer holding me back, I can finally work at a faster pace.
