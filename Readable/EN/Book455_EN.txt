Hapless traveler, what brings you to this deep underground cave?
Did the legendary tales of Hasad the Golden Adventurer entice you so?
Know that the tales told the world over are but a speck of sand compared to what I have experienced.
Only the nameless god of the desert knows what terrible misfortune has befallen me.
Those ancient secrets unbeknownst to anyone,
They have laid layer upon layer of curses on me,
And I have become the oracle of a creature invisible.

Three challenges I have set forth, by order of the evil spirit watching me from the shadows.
Within them I hide treasures brought forth from the cursed city of brass.
If fear shall not stay your greed and curiosity,
Then follow my path.

Beside the deep tunnel that leads to the pit of filth where countless Dev once dwelt,
The wails and screams of death echo across the ruins.

When the flames are lit in the correct order,
In the same way you came here,
I shall be free from this endless curse.

But those eternal beings can never perish,
Until death has become the end of death.
