1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Life is like fishing

2
00:00:03,325 --> 00:00:05,150
It cannot be rushed

3
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:10,100
Whatever you do, impatience will accomplish nothing

4
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:13,150
I was just like you once

5
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:15,575
Desperate to prove myself

6
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,375
Only later did I realize

7
00:00:18,575 --> 00:00:21,550
Things do not always turn out the way you plan

8
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:24,800
But you have to keep calm to carry on

9
00:00:25,975 --> 00:00:28,675
You're still young. Be patient

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,100
Believe in yourself

11
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:34,425
And don't look outside yourself to prove your value

12
00:00:40,275 --> 00:00:42,550
...Where's Zhiyi these days?

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,300
It's been a long time since he last paid me a visit

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,700
Maybe he's just busy...

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,050
Hmph, well next time

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,400
If he doesn't bring a pot of piping hot fish soup, don't let him in!

17
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,825
Whatever you were thinking about, you'll have plenty of time to mull it over in prison

18
00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:08,125
Oh, I almost forgot

19
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:10,825
If the Fatui find out what happened today

20
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,000
Prison might not turn out to be the safest place for you

21
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,075
Trying to have friends on both sides... it has a way of turning everyone against you

22
00:01:19,702 --> 00:01:20,777
But right now

23
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:23,575
I have an opportunity for you
