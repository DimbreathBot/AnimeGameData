...To my dear friend, Mehrak...
...Three times has Hibehrous requested that funds be sent out in the name of "alleviating the situation in disaster-stricken areas" and "repairing the oases and irrigation systems," and has indeed made much ado about it, though perhaps not out of goodwill, I fear...
The priests' calculations indicate that such a motion would add much unnecessary burden upon the treasury without any concrete benefit in return.
...This person is of mean birth and has no backing in the Council of Nobles. Only by the request of His Majesty Parvezravan that he quell rebellions has he attained high rank. And now, he asks for gold and silks, ruins honest folk, and rouses the rabble! Truly does he hold us nobles in contempt...

...We are but humble subjects who serve our great king out of the nobility handed down to us by our forebears. How can we hand our hard-earned fortunes over to these indolent louts and rogues? Is not the protection of one's property the most basic of rights?

...Moreover, this fellow was born to mountain shepherds, making him by nature rebellious and cruel, given to bold-faced violence.
Though he may be a General of the Cavalry and may have His Majesty Parvezravan's ear... But with how he ruins the greater body to enrich himself, and how he indulges in sloth and lapsing judgment, one cannot say for sure that he is not one of Brass Mask's accomplices...
...I urge all my fellow nobles to look into this matter and stay on your guard!
...Enclosed in this letter is a certificate for 300,000 silvers, as a small token on my part...
