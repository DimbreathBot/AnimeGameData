A white wild flower that used to cover the earth.
It has not withered one bit, and still gives off an exquisite fragrance.

In the days when wildlife still roamed the earth and monsters had not yet appeared,
the Viridescent Venerer would use this flower to conceal her human scent.
Thus it was said that to seek the silent and gentle Viridescent Venerer,
one simply need to close one's eyes and walk barefoot through the forest, following the subtle fragrance of wild flowers.
Only those who could tread as softly as a hunter could avoid making the leaves crackle underfoot, alerting the queen of hunters to their presence.

It was also said that the one who eventually found the hunter was a boy.
At that time, disaster had just befallen the ancient kingdom and misery was spreading across the land.
