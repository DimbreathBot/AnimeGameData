His Majesty Parvezravan, the Spirit of Victory, has been lax of late in the practice of his faith in King Deshret. The temples and the carvings have not been maintained in some time.
As priests, we believe that the shrinking of the oases, the deterioration of the harvests, and the rise of the Brass Mask heresy all find their roots in this lapse in faith... Failing in one's faith is tantamount to a failure of morality, and moral rot leads a nation to chaos. We urge the High Priest to remonstrate with His Majesty in time...

...Queen Shirin has ceased to be seen at court, and His Majesty Parvezravan does not ask after her whereabouts. Perhaps the folk tales of the "Demon Queen" may yet be true... Or perhaps it may be possible to exaggerate that title and turn folk-gossip to better ends, such as suppressing the spread of this Brass Mask heresy...
