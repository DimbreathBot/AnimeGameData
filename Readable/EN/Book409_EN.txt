Acidic nutrients extracted from the Sunsettia were mixed with the oil extracted from the fish liver. When the mixture was purified, the formation of a fine, powdery substance was observed.

Over the course of a week, Forest Boars to whom this substance had been administered suffered first from damaged and diseased skin mucous membranes, followed by respiratory failure, then death.

The mixing and purification procedure was then repeated, but replacing the Sunsettia with concentrated Sunsettia juice and the fish liver with concentrated fish-liver paste. A large quantity of the powdery substance was produced.

When Forest Boars were administered this dose, the time to death was reduced from one week to a few hours.

See appendix for lethal dose analysis.
