"Guide" is too grand a title for me, but I'd love to be everyone's friend. It's something I think I'm good at, and I'm an attentive listener, so do let me know when you feel lost! To use an analogy, I'm like a torch out in the wild that will help illuminate everyone's path so long as it continues to burn bright.

(Everything written below is not meant for Collei! Dear Collei, if you're reading this, please turn away!)

I've been worried about Collei lately. She's recovered from the illness, but she still doesn't look all that cheerful. It feels like... she still has things she can't let go of.

Allow me to write down my wish here: I hope that Collei can uncover the secret behind the prophecy and find her happiness. Wherever she is and whoever she becomes, I'll always be her friend no matter what.

We're not the savior and the saved, but simply good friends!
