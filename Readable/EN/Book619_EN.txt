...We were attacked...
...The sudden rampage of the defense mechanisms from the previous set of ruins had already caused massive losses to our investigative team...
...Abyssal monsters that never should have been here appeared for some unknown reason... So many members of the team have vanished while trying to evacuate...
...Ever since the monsters appeared, we have lost track of Klingsor's whereabouts. Has he betrayed us? Or did we truly go too far? I don't know, but this may be my last entry...
...Regardless, if the results of this expedition cannot be brought back to the Akademiya, it will be a great loss for the entire world...
