1
00:00:03,725 --> 00:00:04,800
I don't know why

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:06,525
But the way you're talking...

3
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:09,150
It just doesn't sound like you at all

4
00:00:10,103 --> 00:00:10,823
Lumine...

5
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:12,510
This whole thing

6
00:00:12,817 --> 00:00:13,560
Your plan...

7
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:15,687
What does it have to do with us?

8
00:00:24,051 --> 00:00:25,007
All along...

9
00:00:26,082 --> 00:00:27,715
It's only ever been about us

10
00:00:32,885 --> 00:00:33,424
Goodbye

11
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:34,389
Aether

12
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:37,560
We will begin anew...

13
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:39,917
At the end of your journey
