(An old notebook. Someone has written in it with neat handwriting.)
Good grief, this really is a dangerous island... I never expected that casually fumbling into a room carried the risk of being locked in a secret chamber.
Whoever reads this note — that's right, I'm talking about you — you must surely have been trapped in this secret chamber too. Bet you've got this frown on your face and a chronic case of uncontrollable sighing.
But your reliable ol' senior — that's me — discovered a hint that someone etched into the wall! While I don't know which kindhearted soul left it there, it is indeed a means of escaping this secret chamber.
After careful analysis, I've deduced that it means that one must "light the torches in a certain order"...
I finally succeeded after many attempts, and hurriedly left the method to unlock the chamber behind for the next adventurer who gets stuck in here — looks like that's you!

So, if you succeed, don't forget to thank me.
Your run-of-the-mill adventurers wouldn't have been so attentive as to notice the etchings in the wall like I did.

This island seems to conceal many secrets, so I'll be going ahead of you to the ruins in the mountains!
