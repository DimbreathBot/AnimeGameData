That Asha's really just a bad omen. Why is it so obsessed with dyeing the flower fields in such ominous colors? Yesterday it was a mess of purple and orange, like a twisting, flying serpent from the desert. The day before that was an awful clash of red and green, with circles of all shapes and sizes scattered throughout. A single glance forces me to stop and consciously regulate my breathing for a while, lest my heart starts skipping bars instead of beats. The creature may fancy itself an artist, but its "art" is avant-garde to the point of absurdity. Would could even stand to look at these?

Lately, I've been spending all my time waging war against it. I once wondered if I could block it out â€” keep it from entering the play area, but the whole field is too large to block off. I tried to block the Asha's route itself, but by the time I set up a fence, I realized the blasted thing can jump higher than a Yumkasaurus. And once I dropped my guard, it got right back to its "artistic endeavors." I swear, it's driving me crazy. I can't chase it, I can't catch it. It paints, and I clean up, and I tell you, cleanup takes forever. Once I wipe the sweat off my brow, I raise my head and get treated to the sight of its next painting. Does it have something against me? We go back and forth and back and forth and back and forth every day... I dare say that fitness maniac coach from the Collective of Plenty doesn't work out half as much as I've been made to...

The resort's about to open for business. This cannot continue. Today, I finally swallowed my pride and begged, "Please, o great Asha, please stop painting. Let me eat and sleep in peace." It chirped back in some language I didn't understand... but it did cease its painting.

Good. Let's just leave the fields blank... emptiness is the greatest form of beauty.

I can finally go get some food, and I hope the Asha gives me more time... Otherwise, I don't know how long I can keep this up.
