The pipelines are having problems yet again. Spent the whole day checking but couldn't fix them.
...

A weird guy came over, said he wanted to be an assistant. He looked way older than his voice sounded.
I didn't want any trouble, so I was just honest about it and told him if he wanted to be my assistant, he'd have to work for free. I barely have enough savings to pay for my own meals â€” no way I could I fork out wages on top of that.
But he said he didn't want payment, just a place to use. He knew that this isn't private property, just an abandoned building that failed to become part of the Fortress.
No idea how he found that out, but nothing I could do about it. It certainly has more than ample room for two weirdos who're into clockwork meka.
...

He always locks himself up when modifying the meka, probably because he's afraid of me stealing his techniques.
But other than that, I'd say he's a wonderful partner. Not only did he fix the pipelines, he even installed regulator valves. Also, haven't ever run short on energy storage devices since he came. I guess he wasn't joking about having solid Institute connections.
...

We've ended up with a huge number of clockwork meka without me even realizing it. I could see them roaming around when I woke up in the middle of the night.
Don't think things are going particularly well for him. He talks to himself a lot and even screams at the meka. They seem to be afraid of him, but can clockwork meka even feel fear?
I think his nerves are rubbing off on me. I should get out of here for a bit, enjoy some fresh air.
Even though I was here first... I ought to say goodbye to him before I leave.
