1
00:00:00,896 --> 00:00:07,425
Long ago, humans rejected Melusines, and Melusines feared humans

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,650
There was one Melusine who became fascinated with human medicine

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,319
But no human wanted her help

4
00:00:16,275 --> 00:00:21,719
And there was one girl who liked Melusines

5
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:26,263
So no humans would make friends with her

6
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:29,655
So, the Melusine became the girl's friend

7
00:00:31,475 --> 00:00:34,861
And the girl became the Melusine's "patient"

8
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:38,424
Your checkup's all done. You're still in perfect health

9
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,675
Thank you, Doctor Melusine!

10
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:51,260
In this game of doctor and patient, a friendship was born

11
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:56,575
Then one day, the girl fell ill

12
00:00:56,575 --> 00:00:59,324
The Melusine was the only doctor to arrive on time

13
00:01:02,475 --> 00:01:08,348
So just because I'm not human... I can't save my best friend?

14
00:01:08,846 --> 00:01:12,622
Scram! Melusines can't be trusted!

15
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:15,950
So just because I'm not human... I can't save my best friend?

16
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,006
In desperation, the Melusine approached the frightening witch

17
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:27,534
She begged, and begged, until she got a reply

18
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,894
If you take this potion, concocted of sin

19
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,710
You will gain a human face and grow human limbs

20
00:01:38,175 --> 00:01:41,614
But then, you will lose everything that attracted this friend of yours to you in the first place

21
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:53,000
Can you accept that?

22
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,500
The Melusine did not hesitate for very long

23
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:04,470
On a rainy night, a little doctor knocked on the girl's door

24
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,886
The doctor wore a hood and raincoat

25
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:12,470
Maybe to protect her from the rain... but maybe also to hide a secret

26
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,875
The little doctor held the girl's hand and treated her illness

27
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,557
Just as she had so many times before

28
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,357
Dawn came, and the little girl's condition improved
