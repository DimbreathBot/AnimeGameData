Travels are full of meetings and partings.
Perhaps the only trusty and inseparable companions of a Traveler,
Are the sword in their hand and the dream in their heart.

Before growing old, the eternal Traveler shall pass through many worlds.
Leaving behind naught but stories beyond count and a slightly brighter future.
