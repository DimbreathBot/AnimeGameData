Someone else was taken. That makes six.
Or perhaps the seventh? Someone tried to escape yesterday but was caught. She hasn't been seen since.
Was that yesterday? Maybe not. I've long since lost track of time.
Sorry. I don't know if writing this is of any use, or how much longer I can do it for.
I can already see my fate approaching. But what terrifies me even more is...
The thought of seeing others from the troupe here.
Have I truly protected them?
Sorry. I'm so sorry. I can write no more...
