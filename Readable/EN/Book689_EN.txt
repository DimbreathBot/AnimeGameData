This locking mechanism can only be opened by two people simultaneously. <color=#00E1FFFF>The energy storage unit has been removed from the front research terminal</color>.
The Geode Mine Shaft has been equipped with a Flying Energy Thief. Initializing the front research terminal with an energy storage device is not advised unless protective measures have been taken.
The Flying Energy Thief is a trial product that has not undergone internal or peer review. <color=#00E1FFFF>It will pursue any entity carrying an energy storage device and disable said device</color>.
Loss of control or explosions occurring during the trial product's operation will be considered unfortunate accidents for which the manufacturer is not liable.
It is strongly advised not to leave from here. Work in the production zone is arduous, but at the very least, it is not life-threatening.
