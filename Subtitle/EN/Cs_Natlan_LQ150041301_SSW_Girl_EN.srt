1
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,195
Hmph!

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,425
What do we do?

3
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:15,814
We can't open the Rift...

4
00:00:30,336 --> 00:00:31,700
...Kill me!

5
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:33,730
Put an end...

6
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,492
To Huitztlan's

7
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:37,279
Shame...

8
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:43,696
By past fuel

9
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,764
And present flame

10
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,475
Life marches ever on

11
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:52,654
Burkina...?

12
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:57,075
I must atone...

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,596
Patience

14
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,525
We will answer to the fire

15
00:01:07,997 --> 00:01:09,125
For all our deeds

16
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:12,032
Even if one day I fall behind

17
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:14,000
Never look back

18
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,950
Keep moving forward

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,290
As we are now

20
00:01:23,755 --> 00:01:25,300
...Live with your guilt and shame

21
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:28,056
This is the price to pay

22
00:01:33,425 --> 00:01:35,575
Heir to the Turnfire...

23
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,886
Please use my ruined vessel...

24
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,025
To train the heroes of the future

25
00:01:41,975 --> 00:01:44,096
The will of Kongamato...

26
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:46,700
Will march ever on

27
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,875
Till the Abyss is stamped out
