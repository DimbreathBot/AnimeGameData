(The writings on this Obelisk are rough and messy, a far cry from the elegant writing earlier.)
This Obelisk was established to celebrate the great deeds of Muzaffar Dey.
Hail Muzaffar Dey, overlord of the great harbor-city Orghana, kin-uncle to the beasts of the sea, explorer of the gilded rivers, Wenut-Conqueror!
He set forth from Orghana to pillage the cities, and he slew many, and hundreds of thousands he enslaved, and thus did the savage tribes of the gilded sands and the cowering ilk of the feeble cities acknowledge his mastery.
...He took the famed city Beit Raha and tore down its walls and towers... presented the head of Nasrul, the master of the city, before his brothers and comrades. They made mockery of it, and their joy was equal in greatness to its stench.
...Three thousand were taken and sold... ten thousand silver bars...
...Nasrul's daughter Nazira was made ruler of Beit Raha... may the distant seas guide her to rule her realm well.
