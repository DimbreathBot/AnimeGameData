Back then, the pitch-dark, muddy currents had not yet crept into the barren tundra, and even the poor and lowly could sleep peacefully, protected by the noble fae.
But a life of dull toil, lived without dreams, cannot be termed as suffering at all. Everyone was assured a small reward for their labor, enough to stay warm,
For the Tsar of all Snezhnaya had a merciful heart as vast as the icy sea, and was generous even to the small and short-lived.
Besides, the noble princes understood the ancient wisdom that living in unbridled luxury could corrupt fragile mortal souls.
Hence, they alone would not struggle amidst hunger and cold, for it was they who had to bear the sin of fullness for the sake of the people.
Such compassionate wisdom, what paragons of virtue! The nobles and commoners alike sang praises to their ruler's holy name,
Praise unto the master of all fae, who, like a stern father, had painstakingly established a hierarchical system of governance for all beings living through hardship.

But just as the pure white light casts deep shadows, the nobles' good intentions were often lost on the foolish.
And wherever a high wall was built to guard a treasure, those covetous of heart would always be tempted to steal it.
In the days before the dark torrent that swallowed up all life arrived, the master of Elysium and ravens barged into the theater of history.

His name was Reed Miller, the man who would become the master thief renowned across the nations.
No one knew where this master thief had come from, just as no one could uncover his true nature, hidden beneath the endless lies he spun.
Perhaps to mock those dressed in the sacred white, or perhaps to rouse those living in festering hunger, poverty, and resentment,
The man raised the emblem of the black raven. He gathered the forsaken and the despised, and preached bold blasphemies to the very first band of Treasure Hoarders.

"To the poor, to the hungry, to the cold, to the oppressed, and the abused. To my brothers and sisters, all of you who have found your way here..."
"If you have ever suffered injustice at the hands of fate, or if you have ever wept through the night for your neighbor's pain and suffering..."
"If you, too, long for a refuge without fear, and if you, too, dream of a world where no tears are shed,"
"Then you, too, must break free of your chains and join us, your brothers and sisters."
"Let the dead bury the dead, and rise to build an Elysium for the hungry and the poor on the wealth of the high and haughty."
