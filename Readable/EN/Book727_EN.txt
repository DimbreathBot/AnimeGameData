He achieved nothing, he loved no one. He wasted his life in the duelists' ring.
After decades of living like that, RockyÂ Avildsen found everything he owned usurped by his butler, Brandt.
His assets and reputation now belonging to another, he went into self-imposed exile.
He dedicated the remainder of his life to his selfless friends, in pursuit of their dreams.

Friend, you who know of his journey, even be it from accidentally finding this letter,
Or because you have come to discover his fate for the Avildsen family's glory,
<color=#00E1FFFF>Go and collect his assets</color>, his final gift to the world.
