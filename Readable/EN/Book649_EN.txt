Once, in a dream, I saw a black ship.
It sailed through dark night and bleak fog.
The hull was rotten, the mast shattered,
Yet in some perverse jest at human rationality,
Each broken piece had been placed in some twisted way,
Entwined together by the algae and seaweed that enveloped the vessel,
Forming a dreadful dark shadow that shambled through the moonlight,
That none could glimpse and not panic.
Shift your gaze just a little, and in an instant,
It shall appear again before you.
A tall and slim figure standing upon the deck,
Wrapped in dark robes, its face barely seen.
Only its eyes, those two cold eyes,
Which can pierce your soul with a glance.
Was that a monster that arose from the depths of the seas?
A lord returned from some ancient world?
Or perhaps the nightmare itself?
