You who come after us:
She tricked me. The keystone is real! No wonder Jebrael and Samail believed it so strongly... That great engineer really did leave traces here, just as we read from those ancient glyphs!
I thought they were lies meant to obscure history... But now, the place they described is here before our eyes.
This is the third place of worship. Gurabad's secret treasure must be hidden here.
But this keystone is not sufficient. There must be something else...
There must be some other method to open the great gate of Gurabad.
As long as we can find our way inside, we can obtain the treasure. Then this expedition would not have been in vain.
But then... I... What was I even doing...
