Dear Mr. Curve, Ms. Talochard, Ms. Paimon, and {M#Mr.}{F#Ms.} {NICKNAME},
We've moved! But we thought you might come back, so we've left this for you. Mom says we have to keep our new address a secret for now, so I'll share it with you next time. Hee-hee.
Thanks to you guys, I think I can say that I found my own answer this time.
Also, it turns out that Mr. Curve is the kind of person who can't tell a lie! I super admire that. He will always be like a big brother to me!
