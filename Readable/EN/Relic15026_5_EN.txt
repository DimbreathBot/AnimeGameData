"The vision of gold will appear in its most ancient form."
In the beginning, the various tribes lived alongside the sands, their bloodlines connected to the earth.
They followed the law of blood, and feared the memory of famine that ran deep in that blood.

Later, time swept across the land like gravel, and the God King rose up as a result, casting a long shadow.
In that forgotten era, the gods shaped the land, creating oases and flowing springs.
Following the God King's example, the tribes would build high walls, thrones, and gather in prosperous feudal kingdoms.
Imitating the God King's appearance, the feudal states also recalled the days long-past when they had kings and priests.
In those days, the wise kings received oracles from the high heavens, and the land knew not the meaning of disaster...

"The king shall, in wisdom, revive the golden past,"
"And stop the sands of time with divine power untrammeled."

Indeed. The golden age of the king of the ocean of sand and the sand people will come at last.
Yon golden slumber summons thee, wandering sand. In it, there shall be neither sorrow nor parting.
