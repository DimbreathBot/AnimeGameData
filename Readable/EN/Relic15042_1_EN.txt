That was a time when frost's gentle light had long shattered like a silver mirror, but when the new moon had yet to rise.
The descendants of the far north could no longer hear the divine teachings of the high heavens, and they were consumed by burning wrath, just like in the days of old.

No one knew how to forge anew the marvel the apostle of the Golden City had revealed to their ancestors.
