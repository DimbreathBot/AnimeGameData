The last batch of goods was high quality, and the clients were very satisfied. Still, one or two did complain there weren't enough types of command, which is worth consideration. The feed has been delivered at the agreed-upon time. If there is a shortfall, I'll make it up with the next delivery.
Also, if you make any progress with Paran, that useless nephew of mine, please let me know, so I can get ready to give him a welcome. If things work out, I doubt he'll still have any love for the tribe. I've arranged for what comes after — all that's left is for him to come to me. Of course, rest assured that you'll be given your share in full.
Also, have you decided on Soncoyoc's replacement? He sent me a letter to press the issue, the annoying buffoon. Anyway, be sure to reply — I need some way of getting him off my case.
