Patrolling personnel: Riku. Morning. No abnormalities.
Patrolling personnel: Dima. Afternoon. A Tassel Jelly somehow got inside the barrier. It was released. Other than that, no abnormalities.
Patrolling personnel: Riku. Night, *yawn* ... Another Tassel Jelly jammed itself in the barrier. How are they getting in!? Released that one as well. No abnormalities otherwise.
Patrolling personnel: Dima. Morning. Riku, did you not release that jellyfish!? How is it still in there? Did you just forget to do it because you were too sleepy? Also, I forgot to bring my ID card... somehow. I can't be arsed to go get it, so you release it in the afternoon. No abnormalities.
Patrolling personnel: Riku. Afternoon. I could've sworn I released it... Maybe I missed something... I'll pay more attention next time. *sigh* Spent quite a bit of time clearing the jellyfish. No abnormalities otherwise.
Patrolling personnel: Dima. Night. Bah, this sucks! I didn't get a wink of sleep all night... Every time I patrolled, I would find more jellyfish inside the barrier. Also, I keep forgetting to bring my ID card... I've hidden one nearby. Should make it easier to open the door... I'll tell you where it is later. No other abnormalities.
Patrolling personnel: Riku. Morning, no abnormalities.
Patrolling personnel: Dima. Afternoon, no abnormalities.
Patrolling personnel: Riku. Night. Found several jellyfish lying around. Released them all. The ones who couldn't leave, I disposed of... No abnormalities otherwise.
Patrolling personnel: Dima. Morning. The higher-ups said to leave the matter of the jellyfish to the recon bots. No abnormalities.
Patrolling personnel: Riku. Afternoon. I didn't know the recon bots could do that! That's awesome. No abnormalities.
