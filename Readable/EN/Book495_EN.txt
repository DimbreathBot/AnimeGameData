You who come after us:
If there was a prayer in praise of the night, then I would sing its fourth strain in memory of the misfortunate.
For Jebrael, who lost his footing.
"How could one conceive the passing of a cloud, or the death of the blowing wind? How might one mark a grain of sand falling into the desert, or a droplet disappearing into water?"
I believed Jebrael would be the last. He should have been the last.
But who can say? Perhaps the many mishaps broke him, unexpectedly.
Jebrael, so agile and swift! To think that he would fall off the side of the ruins on the gorge.
Unexpected indeed.
Now, I and Samail are the only ones left. Yes, we are the last of this little exploration team.
This journey is cursed! But no matter. Soon, it shall reach its end.
Yes. Soon.
