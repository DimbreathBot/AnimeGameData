Hoo-hahahaha! What's up, compadre? Have ya missed me since we last met at The Chasm?
I mean, you've been on my mind, if that's what you're wondering! In fact, you're the first person I thought of when I came up with this idea!
To celebrate Shinobu's successful graduation and, y'know, show off the almighty awesomeness of the Arataki Gang, I've decided to book a grand venue in Ritou to organize a festival!
We're calling it "The Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival!" How's that? Quaking with excitement already, I'll bet!
I can guarantee that this festival will be as massive as the Irodori Festival and more meaningful than Lantern Rite! Once it's over, the gang's name will spread far and wide, all across Inazuma!
And that's why I thought of you, buddy. I'd love for you to join in on the fun!
We can go nuts! Sing songs! Do some beetle fights! Grill some Lavender Melons!
How about it? Excited? Oh, I bet you are, so hurry down to Ritou, I'll wait for you there!
Ahahahaha!
Uh... Wait, Shinobu, I don't think we need that line about Lavender Melons. It just doesn't sound cool enough.
Hey, I said we didn't need it!
And we don't need this line either... Oh, come on...!
