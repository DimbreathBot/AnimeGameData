...Captain Parshid has fallen unconscious. If we cannot bring down his fever in time, his life will be in critical danger...
...
...The Nagarjunites have relented. As night fell, they sent messengers with medicine and water, saying that they will leave. Apparently, someone has guaranteed that we would cease trespassing in forbidden areas. Naturally, for the sake of the contract and our own safety, we must return to the rainforest with all haste. What rotten luck...
...I asked about the scorpion venom, but their messengers denied any use of poisoned weapons. They only wanted to teach us a lesson, not murder us.
...
...We followed the messengers' instructions and went to the camp of the person who vouched for us. They are to escort us back. How shameful, returning with nothing but empty hands and wounded bodies...
...Their leader is a girl with blue-purple hair and dark skin. She looks young, but the scars covering her body make it clear that she is someone to be feared. She is surrounded by a group of equally capable-looking young desert-dwellers, and they have an interesting mechanical contraption with them. She looks like the leader of a newly-formed mercenary group. She says she wants nothing to do with rainforest dwellers, and she only saved us because it was convenient. Her real target is someone called "Masseira." Some friend of hers has an old vendetta against him, and apparently this Masseira has also ticked off those Nagarjunite scoundrels. That's why they were willing to let her mediate.
...If he was really on the same road as us, perhaps our rotten luck is the result of some ploy of his to cover his tracks? It's worth looking in to...
...
...Those young mercenaries treated Parshid's wound. He is still running a fever, but his life is out of danger. Kamrun returned from the campfire with a dislocated jaw... He must've done something really stupid, like riling up the girl with purple hair...
...Or maybe he tried to steal that construct of hers. Either way, he deserves it!
...
...The purple-haired leader and I agreed on a price to see us safely home. We have to compensate her for delaying her vengeance with a hefty sum. But our highest priority is returning to the Akademiya alive. I hope nobody does anything stupid before we leave tomorrow morning...
