To the Department of Statistics and Mathematics:

Recently, our Institute announced an initiative and implored our fellow citizens to donate books in order to rebuild the Bossuet Library (formerly known as the Alain Guillotin Memorial Library), which was unfortunately destroyed during the accident.
Since the initiative's announcement, the response and generous donations we received from the entire community far surpassed our expectations, providing us with a large number of precious books, and the reconstruction plan is progressing smoothly, as expected.
After conducting a careful study, we have decided to entrust your department (the Department of Statistics and Mathematics) with organizing the book donation information using this form to facilitate contacting and expressing gratitude to all donors in the future.
Refer to the format below:

To Mr. Diodenes:

Is your head royally screwed up or something? Why would you send this to us?
The Department of Statistics and Mathematics isn't the department responsible for this kind of paperwork.
Department Director Maurice Juglar

The forms have been returned untouched in their original packaging. In order to avoid administrative issues, until we hear from Mr. Diodenes, all research assistants of our department are required to fill in the form according to the following format:

Donor's Message: A thank-you gift from a patient who called it a must-read and whispered something about it exposing true history. I flipped through a few pages and found myself completely lost. Might be a relatively valuable history book, or something?

Donated Book: Formula for "Pure Water"
Category: TBD
Donor: Anonymous
Donor's Message: A precious formula that originally belonged to your Institute. I've deciphered it and am returning it to you enclosed, with my gratitude. Thank you.

A precious formula that belongs to us? I don't think I've ever heard of something like that, and it doesn't look all that impressive... Maybe we should just set it aside for now?
