Dear Lauren, my sweetest daughter, I have no choice but to say goodbye to you in this way. Since our separation, not a moment goes by when I do not wish that I could leave the Fortress of Meropide as soon as possible and come back to you — to go back to being the father you looked up to the most.

Perhaps I'm the only one who naively believes that sinners are forgiven. The moment one is handed a sentence, they are already dead, leaving only a husk of flesh that must atone. Nobody shows compassion for the flesh — it is utterly filthy, and utterly worthless.

Don't make the wrong choices, Lauren. Don't do bad things. Live a beautiful life. Do your best to become a better you. Try to embrace all the bright things in this world, and don't leave any regrets behind like I did.

Do not try speaking for me. Nobody here can be trusted. They're all monsters with human faces with not the slightest shred of decency, constantly starving beyond measure. Stay far, far away from this place.

No matter how you feel inside about a father like me, I still want you to know that I wish I could see you, and that I love you very much.
