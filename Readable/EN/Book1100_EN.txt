I found an awesome new job!

It's not like I've never worked as a private tutor before, but Nod-Krai's "upper-class" families... Well, you know what they're like. But Ms. Salme is totally different! Every gesture of hers radiates the elegance of true nobility! Though her elder twin sister, Salomea, is a bit more mischievous (but what child doesn't love pranks at her age?), I do hope they'll grow closer. To see these young ladies blossom into perfect gentlewomen... Why, it would be my greatest pride.

When I was tucking the two darlings into bed, they begged me to sing "Mama in the Sheepfold" for them... It's not my favorite lullaby by a long shot, what with its most quaint lyrics... But since the girls like it, I guess all's well.
