34th Independent Investigative Squad Directive 15

Ever since Lieutenant Malinovskyi went to supervise the northeastern observation tower, the squad has become remiss with their discipline.

In order to restore strict discipline, boost soldiers' sense of duty, create a team mindset, and restore a sense of collective honor within the squad, the following order is hereby given, effective immediately:

NCOs and privates stationed here must assemble before the observation tower daily at the appointed time and eat together in the designated area, when the signal is given by <color=#00E1FFFF>striking the pot</color>. Eating privately without permission is prohibited, and striking the pot on one's own and disrupting the squad's rest time is strictly forbidden.

You are all hereby notified.

34th Independent Investigative Squad Deputy Captain: Second Lieutenant A.M. Shumilov
