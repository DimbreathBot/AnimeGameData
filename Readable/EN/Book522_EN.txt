"And finally, your wishes come true. You will leave that filth that corralled you, and you will lead a comfortable life. You shall not want for food or clothing, and the master who bought you shall also be your attendant slave..."
"Thus will 'happiness' become to you an ingenious deception..."
"But you cannot fool yourself! Your heart screams within you, yes, even now it screams: 'Even if you die, your master remains master still. But if your master dies, then you shall become a masterless slave!'"
"And one day, you will realize that the death you have always feared is, in truth, 'your master's death.' You will find that you have fallen from degradation to true abjection..."
"Perhaps now, you still love the gold chains, laced as they are with silver coin, wrapped about your ankles. Perhaps you even miss their jingle. But on that day, you will understand how you will tear yourself, you who were once born free, from your master's grasp..."
"When they come with threats of death, and ruin your beautiful body, leaving you with blinded eyes, rasping throats, indelible brands, and lasting scars..."
"When you crush his head, strangle his wife, smother his children â€” when you conquer your fear of death and taste again the sweetness of vengeance..."
"Only then shall you understand the value of dying for yourself."
