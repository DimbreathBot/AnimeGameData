Flowers were a rare sight for the scholar who lived in her ivory tower, buried under piles of books.
A young man, who admired the scholar, once gave her this exotic flower in the hope of bringing some life to the dull and lonely days she spent in her study.
The scholar accepted the gift gratefully and made a flower bookmark with it.
Ever since then, there has always been a splash of vivid color hidden somewhere in the pages of the dull piles of books.
