...Unbelievable, I ended up being attacked by the dragon after all. But maybe I should be thanking it... After all, I wouldn't have stumbled upon this place without it...

...The Core of Chu'ulel. Seems like it was once the heart of the entire city. I heard a member of the tribe speaking about it before, how in ancient times the Sacred Lord once transformed himself into the heart of the dragon city, but I never expected the meaning to be so literal...

...Unlike those I've encountered elsewhere, the Secret Source Automatons here seem to be able to understand speech. Did the Sacred Lord make them in order to protect himself? Anyway, at least I don't have to worry about monsters coming after me for now...

...I can't believe it actually worked. I used the Pyrophosphorite on my body to awaken the dragonspirit slumbering within the heart of the machine... But is this little guy really a dragonspirit? It's so small, and absolutely adorable! And it's green like a chunk of turquoise, so I think I'll call it Cocouik...

...It's the path to the Altar of Primal Flame. I saw the signs left by Aunt Liriwu, it really is the same path that ██ walked...

...Still, there's only one chunk of Pyrophosphorite left. I must make sure I don't use it up before I get to the Tonatiuh...
