Experiment Day.
The lab equipment that was ordered hasn't arrived yet. No choice, all I can do is force myself to go to Hotel Debord with Mr. Poitier.
Mr. Poitier recommended the seasonal Poisson oyster with Salacian caviar and a fine Chardon. The Poisson oysters were unquestionably the best — full-bodied texture, plump, soft, and juicy, flavor lingering on the tip of the tongue like a gentle seabreeze. However, the way Mr. Poitier ate them... it could be said to seem a bit inelegant, as the juice accidentally squirted all over the napkin. Such lack of etiquette would definitely be laughed at by others! Anyway, I lectured him about it... Now, if only he would take this to heart...
After all, etiquette is like food. Inferior ingredients can certainly be compensated for through superior culinary techniques, so there shouldn't be any need to discriminate in terms of the quality of ingredients — but even so, people will always prefer premium food with premium ingredients.

Experiment Day.
The lab equipment ordered before still hasn't arrived. No choice, all I can do is force myself to watch an opera with Mr. Poitier.
The refreshments were as tasty as ever, but the play was only passable at best. As far as tragedies go... the farewell scene between Erinnyes and Egeria, at least, succeeded in squeezing a few tears out of some members of the audience (such as Mr. Poitier, though it was expected, given his tastes), not laughter.
There's nothing innately wrong with attempting to show the plot unfolding from the perspective of multiple characters, but if it cannot all be tied back together and the theme properly expressed, and instead completely relies on sensationalizing the climax to cover up all the flaws, then it is absolutely a misguided approach. Take, for example, the adaptation of the famous Lochknight tale, titled "Mounted Python & the Pure Grail," the comedy I previously attended with Mr. Poitier (see Lab Report page 17). It was a superior production in every way... As the great master Alcofribas said, 'tis better to pen laughter than tragedy, for laughter gives strength, and fortifies the will.
Not to mention how mortifying Mr. Poitier's bawling was...

Experiment Day.
The lab equipment previously ordered still hasn't arrived. It appears it may have gotten lost in transit. Can't do anything but force myself to re-order the equipment and then go to Café Lutece with Mr. Poitier once more.
