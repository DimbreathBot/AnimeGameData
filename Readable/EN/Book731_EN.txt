Crafty Bulle Fruit, my brother, you're always in my thoughts.
I can't believe the higher-ups sent Calla Lily to hunt you down just for the formula to that stupid potion. I guess you're Plum out of luck now, huh?
But don't worry, I made a big ruckus in the Order of the Fruit in your defense. They may have kicked me out over it, but I've got no regrets. I only hope your soul can rest in peace.
No one else knows this, but I've also put lots of Bulle Fruits in my new home to remember you by.
Looks like only four of the Five Great Operatives of the Order of the Fruit now remain.
