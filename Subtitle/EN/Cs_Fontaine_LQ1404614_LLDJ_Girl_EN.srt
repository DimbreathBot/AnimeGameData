1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,775
The second cooking contest...

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:04,950
Commences now!

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,125
This time...

4
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:08,575
No more games

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,050
And no holding back!

6
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:08,619
I...

7
00:01:09,315 --> 00:01:11,270
Feel like I don't have a right to be here...

8
00:01:12,214 --> 00:01:12,640
Hey

9
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:14,346
What you so afraid of?

10
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:16,465
You can't unbake it now

11
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:18,496
And if you don't serve it

12
00:01:18,873 --> 00:01:19,979
Then good or bad

13
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:21,861
You'll never find out how to improve

14
00:01:22,838 --> 00:01:23,992
If you're too scared to fail

15
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:26,948
You'll never know what real success tastes like

16
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:28,143
I...

17
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,467
So...

18
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:34,833
...Embrace your failure

19
00:01:35,225 --> 00:01:36,784
Taste it, digest it...

20
00:01:37,286 --> 00:01:38,588
That's the way to success

21
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:40,525
I dunno

22
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:42,845
Sounds like it's easier said than done...

23
00:01:45,436 --> 00:01:45,807
...Mm

24
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:47,070
I'll do it
