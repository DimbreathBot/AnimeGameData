<color=#FFE14BFF>To the battle-hardened connoisseurs of fine wines and fighting arts:</color>
The fine wines meticulously brewed at the Dawn Winery have always quenched people's thirst for the finest liquor. Furthermore, the tax revenues generated by the Winery alone amounted to 11.4%* of the annual expenditure of the Knights of Favonius last year. We are grateful for your patronage and proud to support Mondstadt and its people.
But the prosperity we enjoy today may be at risk.
In recent years, the number of wild monsters has dropped considerably under the repression of the Knights of Favonius. The lives and property of people have been safeguarded, but wildlife has proliferated inordinately due to the lack of natural predators.
Although the Winery has made it its highest priority to secure the vineyard, an average of 10 or more <color=#FFE14BFF>vines are uprooted by boars</color> every week. If this situation persists, the yield of our vineyard will decrease dramatically.

As such, the Dawn Winery is looking for skilled fighters like you, who aspire to preserve Mondstadt and its fine wines:
