To overstep the bounds of one's station is already lese-majeste,
And to delve into forbidden dark knowledge is an even graver offense.

But Rauthvangi never once defended himself, for in his heart he held nothing but that light.
Soon, the court delivered its verdict: the researcher was to be expelled from the Universitas Magistrorum and exiled.
For one of outland stock like him, exile was even more terrifying than the punishment of death.
Exile was, after all, an ancient curse for those who had turned their backs on the gods, and once they returned above ground, that malison would catch up with them swiftly.
A punishment like this was itself already a betrayal of the kingdom's noble ideals, a sign that the underground realm was in decline.

Rauthvangi finally emerged from the cavern, stepping into real sunlight.
Yet, nothing happened to him — unlike the others beside him, who now shrieked in agony.

It was as if the great existence of the cosmos had manifested before him in that instant,
And chosen, above all others, to bestow upon him the grace of darkness.
Fortunately, tragically, he finally came to realize his mission.

"Flames illuminate the world — but they are also what reduce it to ashes."
"And my fate is like that of a moth leaping into the flame."
