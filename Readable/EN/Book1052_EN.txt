...It was you. You let the lumiline through, didn't you?
I know you were responsible for purchasing the problematic ingredient that day.
What would your good friend think, I wonder, if she learned that she suffered on account of your negligence? What would the people in the hotel think?
So. I imagine you'd like to keep this a secret from Escoffier... Wouldn't you, Head Chef Savanna?

...Retrieve the real Codex. By any means necessary!
That's where the real treasure can be found — and you gave it away, like a fool! Well then. You're going to get it back, whether in a bet, or by force, it doesn't matter!
Oh. I know. Don't you have that "cooking showdown" of yours?
...And if you don't think you can win, why, you simply need to have your opponent lose. I imagine that assistant of yours might come in handy in that regard...

What are you dawdling for? She was the one who concealed the secret recipe in the first place!
Why else do you think you've never been able to recreate her work? She's afraid. Afraid that you'll outshine her!
What do you imagine everyone says about you, both within and beyond the hotel walls!? Ordinary, they call you. Untalented! A hack! A failure who will never surpass Escoffier!
And you know whose fault that is? That's right, it's hers... She's no saint, never has been — so why hesitate?
