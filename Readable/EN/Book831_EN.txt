Raven, took an arrow to the heart
And the bake-danuki, shapeshifted into dark
I, Weasel Thief, hereby bequeath all my Mora:
Two hundred goes to my pa
Three hundred to dear mama

Poor little General Crab,
Only a shell remains
Unagi goodbye
Now rest in peace, please don't cry
'Cause we'll get reborn as a beetle next time
Onikabuto, raise your horns
Here's to a world beyond the storm
Of rosy skies
