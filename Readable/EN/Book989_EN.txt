(A Secret Source Sentinel used for recording. Two recordings are within, and they are dated very far apart indeed. One of them goes like this...)
"I'm sorry, Sakkuk... I'm sorry..."
"The feather accessory I made for you... It is in a stone box on my table... I did not think that I, Manqu, would..."
"A promise... cannot... ah..."

(The other, more recent recording, is as follows...)
"I must be careful... This is no place for... Damn it... The Flower-Feather Clan's blockade..."
"Should've known... not to come, haha. But since... to die in the same place as those of yesteryear..."
"Agh... Urgh... Go, go, quick! There are... monsters..."
