1
00:00:01,294 --> 00:00:03,450
It's alright... It's alright...

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,361
You'll see Mommy soon

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:07,497
Nechca...

4
00:00:26,488 --> 00:00:29,248
Keep back. Those are distorted thoughts

5
00:00:29,615 --> 00:00:32,340
...And the mists are the thoughts' twisted cries

6
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,000
If you become tainted by them, they will control you, and you'll never be free again

7
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,509
Where are you...

8
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,282
I don't want medicine... It hurts... It hurts...

9
00:00:49,556 --> 00:00:52,187
Why am I... alone?

10
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,347
N–Nechca? Why...?

11
00:00:58,195 --> 00:01:02,375
No more medicine... Will you stay with me forever?

12
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:06,481
...Please never leave me again

13
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:18,314
Tlazolli

14
00:01:18,314 --> 00:01:20,532
You're the one who twisted Nechca's name

15
00:01:20,532 --> 00:01:22,675
Into a shackling prison

16
00:01:24,082 --> 00:01:26,781
...It's time for you to hear her true voice

17
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:30,925
"Stone engraved and echoing peaks"

18
00:01:31,954 --> 00:01:36,263
"Converge, disperse, in ashes be reborn"

19
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:39,898
"For flames born anew, and the blazing dawn"

20
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:46,188
Mommy will be with you, Nechca...

21
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:50,390
Always and forever...

22
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:56,504
Mommy, I've always been with you

23
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,800
And now, you're finally listening to me

24
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,029
"The old births the new, as flowers shield the roots"

25
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:14,497
"So life ever cycles, until we return to the loam"

26
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:21,384
We've known each other a while, but we've never met

27
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,969
Y–You're... Nechca?

28
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,105
Yes. But I still don't know your name

29
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:32,654
My name's... Nepecha

30
00:02:34,594 --> 00:02:36,127
It really suits you

31
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:43,608
Nepecha

32
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:47,550
I bless you from the past

33
00:02:48,225 --> 00:02:54,420
And wish that every day of your future will be filled with peace and happiness
