1
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:20,018
Run, Skirk. Run!

2
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:26,575
-Please, Skirk... Save me... -Remember, leave no one alive

3
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,816
Heed my words, Skirk

4
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:35,623
Let fear take root in your soul

5
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:38,629
Why did you survive?

6
00:00:39,275 --> 00:00:40,876
Why was it only you?

7
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:42,606
Skirk

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,695
Did you become a positive light in this world?

9
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:00,400
Hey!

10
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,363
This doesn't have to be the end

11
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,430
"Life is a gift. Don't let darkness claim it"
