This is all meant to fulfill Tinet's wish. I do not wish to say that this is her final wish, for I hope it is not so. I have told her every story I know, and even some I do not, but invented to comfort her. Tolfin often comes to see us, and though he is little good at it, he does his best to tell her stories he can barely get through telling, such as "It is a sight more marvelous even than a rainbow, the aurora that hangs in the night sky, though you can only catch sight of it very rarely, even in the northenmost reaches of the northenmost of nations. They say, you know, that you will find treasure at the end of a rainbow. What great prize, then, awaits those who can climb the vivid satins that come rolling down from the very heavens"?
I remember that as Tinet heard this tale, the candlelight flickered, as if a gentle breeze was blowing through. She said, her voice like a sigh, that if only she had heard this story earlier, she might still have the strength to go to that northenmost of nations in the story to see those dreamlike satins in the sky with her own eyes...

...It's alright, child. It's alright. I will bring you those satins, such that you can see them.
