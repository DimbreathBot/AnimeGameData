1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,575
A long, long time ago, in a village lost to time

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:12,025
There lived a crimson oni and a blue oni. They were the best of friends

3
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:17,700
The crimson oni looked fierce, but was gentle like the humans

4
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:23,325
The blue oni looked human, but was reclusive like an oni

5
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,222
The crimson oni wished to befriend the humans, but they were scared

6
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:33,500
And threw beans at him whenever he came near

7
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:40,963
So the blue oni said to the crimson oni:

8
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,450
"Aka, I'll cause trouble in the village, you come and stop me"

9
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,575
"Then the humans will accept you"

10
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,088
As planned, the crimson oni chased the blue oni away

11
00:00:52,325 --> 00:00:56,354
The crimson oni's deeds spread throughout the land

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,950
And people finally accepted him

13
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:05,366
But when the crimson oni went to tell the blue oni the good news

14
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,818
He was gone, and left only a letter behind:

15
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:15,594
"I went traveling. Don't come find me, or they'll treat you as a naughty little oni"

16
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:19,936
"But don't worry about me. No matter where I go..."

17
00:01:20,175 --> 00:01:22,304
"We'll always be friends"
