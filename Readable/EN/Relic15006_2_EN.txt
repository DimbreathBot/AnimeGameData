A forever-burning bird feather.
The fire shall burn for all eternity.

Scorched earth followed in her wake, for she chose a path of hellfire.
Though her fires only touched monsters and demons,
People still cowered behind closed windows and tried to drive her away. But none of that mattered to her.

New hopes were birthed from the fires of old pains.
She needed not comforting nor sympathy.
Chirping by her side, the birds gave her all the understanding she needed.
