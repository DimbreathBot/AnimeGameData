1
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:17,076
The Fire Seed shattered!

2
00:00:17,342 --> 00:00:18,575
And Nahida's, she's...!

3
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:19,977
I know

4
00:00:20,456 --> 00:00:22,248
A sacrifice must be made

5
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:24,578
But not by the Lord of Dendro

6
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,325
We've all grown on this long journey

7
00:00:32,705 --> 00:00:35,595
If the purpose of that growth was to return home

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,975
Then our wishes have come true

9
00:00:45,994 --> 00:00:47,750
Would you lend us your power?

10
00:00:51,478 --> 00:00:53,140
You knew it would come to this...

11
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:54,917
All the knowledge

12
00:00:55,548 --> 00:00:56,215
Language

13
00:00:56,675 --> 00:00:58,204
And emotions that you have learned

14
00:00:58,943 --> 00:01:02,137
Will be reverted into pure elemental energy

15
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:05,905
In your new homeland

16
00:01:06,245 --> 00:01:08,203
Nothing of who you were will remain

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,606
You won't be remembered by anyone...

18
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:13,240
Is that truly...

19
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:15,802
The return you've always dreamed of?

20
00:01:17,098 --> 00:01:18,698
Lord of Dendro

21
00:01:18,831 --> 00:01:20,762
Don't be sad

22
00:01:21,237 --> 00:01:22,511
This is not

23
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:23,983
Your home

24
00:01:25,132 --> 00:01:25,779
We

25
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:26,998
Go home

26
00:01:27,742 --> 00:01:29,131
Lord of Dendro

27
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,655
Should also

28
00:01:30,796 --> 00:01:31,930
Go home

29
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:43,817
Hear us please

30
00:01:44,553 --> 00:01:46,378
Feel our heartfelt desires!

31
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:48,375
Awaken!
