Traversing an abandoned mine choked with smoke and dust, arranging for the workers leading the way to rest elsewhere, before moving the broken stones aside — oil lamp in hand — and uncovering the poison buried there years before by a desperate outlaw.
Visiting a ascetic living secluded in the mountains and engaging them in amicable conversation. Discovering a letter placed on the corner of a tattered bookcase, thus proving this person was in fact a spy who held vital information.
Casually strolling into the Northland Bank and taking a seat as a business expert. Prodding and probing, getting them to reveal where their funds were directed...
In Yelan's world, such experiences have long become routine.
While endlessly perfecting her secret list of names, she regularly rubs shoulders with dangerous people. Failure carries the risk of death, and so she must continuously hone her powers of disguise.
She can become a novice geological surveyor, wearing spectacles and speaking in careful, nervous tones.
She can become a master ink painter, dressed in fine silks and exuding elegance with every gesture.
Or she can become an investor, impeccably dressed and well-mannered, with every gracious word disarming her opponents...
She is a woman of many faces.
In times of need, Yelan can even disguise herself as an ordinary person whose appearance, silhouette, and voice radically differ from her own...
And because of these unique experiences, she has accumulated countless outfits — enough to fill several closets across multiple secret bases of operations.
She has acquired such an understanding and appreciation of various outfits that she now has an eye for fashion and ability to pair clothes together comparable to those of experts.
As the proprietor of Yanshang Teahouse, Yelan is always busy, yet she somehow has a knack for finding time to relax, fitting in games of dice where she can. With her years of experience, she has earned the nicknames "Dice Master" and "Dice Demon," though it's hard to say whether in praise or fear.
When traveling in her own guise, Yelan's reputation and standing provide her with many advantages.
After all, no matter where she goes, only a fool would slight the esteemed owner of Yanshang Teahouse.
When receiving the highest standards of hospitality, it's important to display the correct level of decorum.
And the outfit she wore while on holiday in Fontaine is in keeping with her status as a distinguished guest.
Yelan herself designed this evening dress before entrusting it to several talented yet unheralded dressmakers to bring to life.
A marriage of elegance and efficiency — a perfect blend of leisurely relaxation and ruthless precision.
The material for the cape was carefully selected, with a texture akin to the Whitesilk Mantle, providing Yelan with a familiar comfort.
The Fascinating Bracelet has also donned a new look — its exquisite Starsilver casing and ghostly blue gemstone transformed into a mood‑changing "dessert"...
Whether taking in a riveting performance at the Opera Epiclese or enjoying a delicious feast at the Hotel Debord, this outfit blends in seamlessly.
Even though Yelan's vacation in Fontaine was interrupted, and this dazzling dress had to wait until the most pivotal moment to light up the stage...
Somewhat unexpected journeys like this are like falling dice coming to rest in a dark corner.
With pleasant surprises waiting to be counted, like chilis, Adeptea, and strong cocktails...
Unpredictability makes for the most enchanting memories.
