...It seems the ordinary Dahri machines can no longer satisfy him. As a result, the director used national resources to obtain something truly horrifying. Rumor has it that someone was nearly killed! I hope this will help him achieve his research objectives... They even got him some rare Dahri mechanical parts being studied by Sumeru researchers as part of the package...

...Things went out of control for a third time! Guillotin may be willing to risk his own life, but that doesn't mean the rest of us feel the same... I came up with an emergency damage control strategy, and I hope we won't need to use it before he finishes his kinematics research. However, given his personality, it seems unlikely that he'll ever truly complete that research...

...
...It seems that his experiments into machines were intended to create a mechanical dog as proof of his accomplishments in kinematics and material science. It's actually a good idea and could be showcased in the city, and the creature is much more personable and likable compared to the automated turret next door...

...At least he lived long enough to be poached by the Marechaussee Hunters. It wasn't easy for us to survive this long, either. But what will we do with this blasted crazy killing machine that can repair itself!? Whatever... That's a problem for future generations...
