Act I
Cast: Kurotani Seishimaru ({NICKNAME}), Wakayama Keisuke (Sasano), Yano Machiko (Koharu)
Inside a restaurant that Seishimaru and Keisuke frequent.

Wakayama Keisuke: It's been a while, Seishimaru.
Wakayama Keisuke: I've heard that you're in charge of the Kurotani Clan's affairs now.
Wakayama Keisuke: Looks like the dust has settled since that incident.
Wakayama Keisuke: Lord and Lady Kurotani are gone...
Wakayama Keisuke: But you're taking up the mantle as their eldest {M#son}{F#daughter} to continue to serve the public.
Wakayama Keisuke: I'm sure they would be pleased.
Kurotani Seishimaru: <color=#00E1FFFF>Can the dust settle before vengeance is had?</color>
Wakayama Keisuke: You? You want to take revenge?
Wakayama Keisuke: We're not children anymore, how can you still be just as impulsive as you were back then?
Wakayama Keisuke: *sigh* With Lord Kurotani's abilities, the investigation never should have gone as wrong as it did.
Wakayama Keisuke: But he said himself that he was willing to accept the blame and punishment.
Wakayama Keisuke: The punishment from the great lords was indeed harsh...
Wakayama Keisuke: But Lord Kurotani asked for it himself. I fear that there is still much left unsaid here.
Wakayama Keisuke: Kurotani and Wakayama are both reputable clans.
Wakayama Keisuke: You now carry the clan name. You're a samurai in service of the public, not some wandering Nobushi ronin.
Wakayama Keisuke: So no matter how angry you are, you must be patient right now. You mustn't seek revenge.
Kurotani Seishimaru: What's suspicious is some of the great lords' men!
Kurotani Seishimaru: They've been mighty pleased with themselves since my father's death.
Wakayama Keisuke: That's your anger clouding your judgment. They didn't necessarily have anything to do with it. Calm down!
Seishimaru looks out the door.
Kurotani Seishimaru: <color=#00E1FFFF>Whoever's eavesdropping outside, come on in.</color>
Wakayama Keisuke: Who are you? Who sent you to listen in on our conversation?
Machiko shows herself.
Yano Machiko: M—My apologies, good samurai, I—I'm just a tea seller, and my name is Machiko.
Yano Machiko: It wasn't my intention to eavesdrop.
Yano Machiko: Seishimaru saved my life yesterday, and {M#he}{F#she} didn't ask for rice or money.
Yano Machiko: I just wanted to repay {M#him}{F#her} and then go back to selling my tea. I didn't mean any offense, honest!
Keisuke looks at Seishimaru. Seishimaru nods.
Wakayama Keisuke: You... Forget it, it's to be expected that a mere tea vendor wouldn't know proper etiquette.
Wakayama Keisuke: Still, remember to address {M#him}{F#her} as "Master Kurotani" from now on.
Wakayama Keisuke: You know what? This is quite opportune. The Kurotani Clan needs people, after all.
Wakayama Keisuke: Why don't you stop selling tea and go with Master Kurotani?
Yano Machiko: I don't wish to call {M#him}{F#her} Master Kurotani. Seishimaru has a better ring to it.
Yano Machiko: And well, if I can get my fill of food, then sure! I'll follow Seishimaru.
Wakayama Keisuke: ...Do whatever you like. Seishimaru, Lord Kurotani is gone...
Wakayama Keisuke: You're in charge of things now. Don't do anything foolish.
Wakayama Keisuke: If you let your temper get the better of you... *sigh* Anyway, what's important is that your family name continues.
Kurotani Seishimaru: <color=#00E1FFFF>It wasn't your adoptive parents who died.</color>
Wakayama Keisuke: ...Seriously? Has anything I've said made it through that thick skull of yours?
Wakayama Keisuke: Let me ask you this. Will you really raise your blade against the great lords' men without a care for your clan!?
Wakayama Keisuke: Do you really wish to bring shame to your lord and disaster upon your family?
Seishimaru remains silent.
Wakayama Keisuke: Oh, great. This is just great! So no one shall have peace until your rage dissipates, yes?
Wakayama Keisuke: Well, since all my efforts to persuade you otherwise have been ineffective, then let me give you the truth straight out.
Wakayama Keisuke: Now, I've been the head of the Wakayama Clan since my father passed away.
Wakayama Keisuke: He served as Lord Kurotani's executioner.
Wakayama Keisuke: I know very well that he wronged your family and did great hurt to its name.
Wakayama Keisuke: And the execution was a matter of business, yes. But you're still my friend, and I still want to look after your family if at all possible...
Wakayama Keisuke: So, if you still want revenge, I fear I must say that my father is already dead.
Wakayama Keisuke: Come on then, punish me for his sins instead. I dare you.
Wakayama Keisuke: What? Are you hesitating because we are friends?
Wakayama Keisuke: Is that the extent of your resolve? Really? You can't even cut ties with me!
Kurotani Seishimaru: I was adopted anyway. The family name means nothing to me.
Kurotani Seishimaru: Besides, is the good standing of the "Kurotani" name really more important than my parents' lives?
Kurotani Seishimaru: Well, I'll show you my resolve. Draw your weapon!
Kurotani Seishimaru: Put it and that Temari over there on the table.
Seishimaru closes {M#his}{F#her} eyes.
Kurotani Seishimaru: I'll close my eyes until you've placed them. Then, I'll extend a finger.
Kurotani Seishimaru: If I point at your sword, then we must face each other in battle. If I point at the Temari, then we will sever all the bonds that lie between us.
Kurotani Seishimaru: Let us leave this to fate.
Wakayama Keisuke: Hmph, so be it. We're all set.
The sword is on Seishimaru's left and the Temari is on {M#his}{F#her} right. Eyes closed, Seishimaru <color=#00E1FFFF>points to the left</color> and then opens {M#his}{F#her} eyes.
Kurotani Seishimaru: It looks like our destiny has been decided. My life shall be devoted to vengeance. There shall be no rest till one of us is dead.
Wakayama Keisuke: Since you've made up your mind, then I must man up as well.
Wakayama Keisuke: I'll carry everything I said before through to the end. I'll be waiting for you.
Wakayama Keisuke leaves.
