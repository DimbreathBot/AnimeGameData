1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,765
Long ago, when plagues ravaged the land

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,351
One doctor made a pledge

3
00:00:07,745 --> 00:00:11,301
To rid the world of pain and suffering

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,970
But even the most ingenious mortal medicine

5
00:00:17,472 --> 00:00:19,840
Could not stay the tide of disease

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,500
And after working tirelessly for many years

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,094
Even his dearest loved ones fell sick

8
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:29,847
And bade their final farewell

9
00:00:31,825 --> 00:00:35,025
Legends told of an Herblord in Chenyu Vale

10
00:00:35,314 --> 00:00:38,534
Who could cure any illness known to mankind

11
00:00:39,617 --> 00:00:41,732
The doctor sought the Herblord

12
00:00:42,058 --> 00:00:48,553
But found only a white snake, its breathing weak and its power all but spent

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,049
"Sign this contract, and let our lives be joined"

14
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:58,145
"Then I will impart to you the secret art of healing"

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,745
"But be warned: This art will harm your own health"

16
00:01:03,777 --> 00:01:06,199
With means beyond human ken

17
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:10,267
The doctor could now reverse the process of death

18
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:15,607
And yet, the time still came to say goodbye

19
00:01:16,513 --> 00:01:22,475
Only now... the one departing was the doctor, his life force spent

20
00:01:23,435 --> 00:01:27,979
His final act in life was to pass on the contract

21
00:01:28,226 --> 00:01:32,331
To his final patient: his favorite disciple

22
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:40,065
The disciple chose to dedicate their life to saving the lives of others...

23
00:01:41,537 --> 00:01:46,849
And generation upon generation followed in these footsteps

24
00:01:53,761 --> 00:02:01,405
Since I inherited this contract, I've always respected the path taken by my predecessors

25
00:02:02,257 --> 00:02:05,862
And followed it myself unquestioningly

26
00:02:06,942 --> 00:02:08,542
That is, until...

27
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,563
I tried to use the art to save my own disciple's beloved

28
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:17,403
She begged me not to use up my own life force

29
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:23,641
She said that this art is a poisoned chalice, an evil and unnatural practice...

30
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:31,812
She did not wish to sacrifice one life for the sake of another, when both were lives she treasured

31
00:02:33,712 --> 00:02:39,858
...Only then did it occur to me: Did I not suffer when my master passed away

32
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:45,217
Just as patients' families do at their loved ones' deathbed?

33
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:49,359
Are not the lives cut short by this contract

34
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:53,322
Just as worthy of saving as any patient's?

35
00:02:55,192 --> 00:03:00,662
What is this contract to us? Medicine, or poison?

36
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:06,735
Alas, I no longer have enough time left to find the answer

37
00:03:08,181 --> 00:03:13,877
I entrust to your care both Changsheng and this final question

38
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:20,213
May you find a remedy for this conundrum, which has ailed us so...

39
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:25,807
Time and again... No matter how much I try to warn them

40
00:03:25,975 --> 00:03:29,687
Or balance their qi, I can never save them...

41
00:03:30,928 --> 00:03:33,207
And you? What's your answer?

42
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,032
...If I abandoned the contract and left you without a host, what would happen?

43
00:03:38,032 --> 00:03:43,684
Hmm... I suppose I'd spend my final moments taking a nice nap on Mt. Yaojun

44
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:48,700
Then, I'd be reunited with my old friends, and your predecessors

45
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,896
Then it's decided

46
00:03:51,303 --> 00:03:54,183
If there's a life in front of me that deserves to be saved

47
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:57,589
Why shouldn't I do everything within my power to save it?

48
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,776
...*sigh* Once again, it's the same answer

49
00:04:03,153 --> 00:04:05,775
So be it. Close your eyes

50
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:10,610
...Who knows how many more people will take on this contract

51
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:12,435
None

52
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,531
This contract... will end with me
