1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:08,025
You opened your eyes in the bitter cold with the hope for a better world

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,550
Only to be greeted by the sight of your brother being impaled by chains

3
00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:20,675
A foreign goddess descends from the skies and takes away your only kin

4
00:00:21,598 --> 00:00:27,600
Yet failing to avenge your twin, you succumbed to a dark slumber...

5
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,250
When you come to, the world around you is not as you remember

6
00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:39,400
Time that remained stagnant for an eternity began flowing anew

7
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:43,825
You embarked on a perilous journey alone

8
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,500
In search of the goddess who took everything from you...
