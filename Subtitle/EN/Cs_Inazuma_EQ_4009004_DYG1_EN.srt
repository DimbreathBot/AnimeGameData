00:00:01,325 --> 00:00:02,950
It's said that long ago

2
00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:06,900
A human samurai once stumbled across the Mikawa Flower Festival

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,000
What's a human doing here?

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,069
We erected the barrier, didn't we? Ugh, what a pain...

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,125
The youkai at the festival began discussing

6
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:24,775
How to drive away the human

7
00:00:25,645 --> 00:00:28,525
When suddenly, they heard a voice

8
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:35,890
This is our festival, and the point is to have fun!

9
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:39,425
What difference does it make if a human joins us youkai!?

10
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:44,275
The speaker appeared to be a prominent figure among the youkai

11
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,400
And when he spoke, the other youkai fell silent

12
00:00:47,538 --> 00:00:50,475
You there, young man. Do you drink sake?

13
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:52,877
...Yes, I do

14
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:58,525
Hah! Then join us. We can enjoy tonight's festivities together. Haha!

15
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:02,825
And so, the youkai and samurai celebrated together

16
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:07,550
The two competed in the highlight of the festival: the Akitsu Hazura (Haneasobi)

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,400
Their spectacular game ended in a draw, and a new friendship was forged...

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,500
Haha, I can't believe a human could keep up with me

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,325
Witnessing the dynamic powers of the youkai

20
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:22,550
Will certainly help hone my swordsmanship

21
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,258
You're a swordsman!?

22
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:28,700
Yes, I'm currently traveling the world in search of formidable opponents

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,350
Then let's make a deal

24
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:33,825
We meet for a duel every ten years, whaddya say?

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,123
I look forward to it
