An hourglass the Thundersoother once used. Flowing within it is not sand, but tiny Electro shards.
The shards shatter and flow down as time passes, then merge together at the bottom of the hourglass.

The Thundersoother who defeated the Beast of Thunder crafted this hourglass from amethyst.
The passage of time is just like lightning. It bursts through the sky and is gone in a flash.
Even the Thundersoother could not conquer the flash of time.

Within this hourglass, even thunder and lightning have to obey the never-changing law of time.
In the hourglass, the shards shatter and merge countless times while time silently flashes by.
Observing this taught the Thundersoother about the cycle of life and death. Empowered with this knowledge, he was able to defeat the beast.
