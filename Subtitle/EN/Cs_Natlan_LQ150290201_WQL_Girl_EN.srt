1
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:03,555
I linger between brushes of memory

2
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:07,325
Seeking the "color" of my final journey

3
00:00:12,707 --> 00:00:14,275
When I get there

4
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:18,650
May there be feathers to paint the sky shades of rose

5
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:27,825
And fields of green to beckon adventurous souls

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,375
And azure oceans with which to sail into the unknown

7
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,500
And volcanos, too

8
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:39,825
Where, despite the danger

9
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,253
Hidden treasure waits to be found

10
00:00:45,973 --> 00:00:48,197
And graffiti art, of course

11
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:50,867
Without that color

12
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:54,325
Just imagine the dullness of night...

13
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:56,950
Anything else?

14
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:01,577
In the end

15
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:05,929
I hope everyone remembers my color, too

16
00:01:21,325 --> 00:01:22,325
In the end

17
00:01:23,586 --> 00:01:26,337
I hope everyone remembers your color, too

18
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:33,545
All in all, it was just a technique for coloring a scroll

19
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:37,385
The task I'm entrusting to you...

20
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:39,364
Is much more than that

21
00:01:41,177 --> 00:01:43,417
Farewell, my friend

22
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:49,425
Preserving these colors in memory...

23
00:01:49,732 --> 00:01:52,292
That's the true duty of the appointed

24
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,300
That way, they're not lost to piles of black and white text
