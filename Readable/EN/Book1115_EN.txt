Current Status:
Kuuvahki energy-harnessing mechanism successfully established. The feasibility of high-density energy barrier generation has been experimentally verified. With current technology, barrier generators can stably produce energy barriers in various shapes, including spherical configurations.
Prolonged, high-intensity generator operation can cause overheating and material fatigue. This not only reduces the device's lifespan but may also result in minor energy leakage. Although currently minimal, the long-term effects are uncertain and could present potential risks. Continued monitoring and attention are advisable.
Data must be collected from multiple sources for aggregated analysis to gain further insight.
