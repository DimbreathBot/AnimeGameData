1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:06,249
Ever heard of the Hexenzirkel? As the spooky name suggests, it's a secret society

2
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:10,924
Once upon a time, it even challenged the Anemo Archon himself. But he replied:

3
00:00:11,324 --> 00:00:15,566
"Let us make music, not war, and resolve our conflicts through song"

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,167
From then on, the mages would only ever convene

5
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:25,519
In the woods, in the skies, or on the edges of cliffs

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,445
At these tea parties, they discussed their stories and secrets and resolved their differences

7
00:00:31,745 --> 00:00:36,690
As the tea and cakes bore witness to their pledge never to fight amongst themselves

8
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:40,601
Yesterday, I snuffed out the life of my beloved

9
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:43,450
He had grown old and was extremely sick

10
00:00:44,846 --> 00:00:50,930
He loved me dearly, so I took his fate in my hands, and ended his pain

11
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:54,005
I'm raising a son

12
00:00:55,092 --> 00:00:59,125
Of all the children I had, he's the only one left

13
00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:05,090
But I suppose that still makes me a mother?

14
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,750
My lifespan is nothing compared to yours

15
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,431
So I wish to leave you with my storybook

16
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:15,813
Actually, maybe you can pass it on to your children one day

17
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:21,632
Ooh, this looks interesting. Let me scry!

18
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:30,538
My dear sisters, we mustn't let prophecies threaten our bonds of friendship

19
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:36,693
Even the most frightening witch was once a little girl

20
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:39,379
And growing up can be so tough...

21
00:01:39,847 --> 00:01:43,266
Sometimes, we all need to vent our troubles to the wind

22
00:01:43,862 --> 00:01:46,086
Even if the nations go to war

23
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:47,882
Or the sky falls down

24
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:53,481
The mages' tea parties shall forever be held around this table
