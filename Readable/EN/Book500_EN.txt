Merchant Log, Expedition No. 39
Day 10 of the Fungi Invasion:
...
Thankfully, we came across a group of farmers in the nearby area. They seem to have been trapped here by the aggressive Fungi too, and have set up a temporary camp.
The kind farmers brought sufficient provisions and medicinal herbs, and almost saved all of us.
But there were still several people who did not make it...
The Fungi surrounding this area are increasing in number, and they're still in that berserk state.
We can't leave just yet, at least not before the Fungi are gone... if they ever leave.
It looks like we'll be staying here for a good while.

Day 42 of the Fungi Invasion:
...
I never thought that I'd become trapped by a bunch of Fungi for so long. I still can't see any hope of getting away from this place.
Rabib took his axe and made an attempt to go fight the Fungi, but he was stopped by the other farmers. Everyone knows that none of us are going to last long without the leader of the farmers around...
But if the circumstances are enough to make the calmest and most composed farmer lose his cool, I can only imagine what the others feel. Everyone must be feeling pretty frustrated by now.
The Zaytun Peaches we picked from nearby areas and the remaining provisions are going to last a few more weeks.
Following the farmers' suggestions, we have started looking for suitable seeds to grow our own food.
And the camp needs an expansion. We have to make plans for the long term â€” we might eventually have to turn this place into a small village.
A village full of Fungi victims? How absurd...
Hopefully, we'll manage to keep ourselves from starving to death before the crops mature.
