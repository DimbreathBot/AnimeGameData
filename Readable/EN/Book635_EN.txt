...This is a short contract. Just a pilgrimage to a site in the north. A simple escort mission, just like being a tour guide.
...The clients are a couple from the rainforest, both scholars from the Vahumana Darshan. The woman is already heavily pregnant. They're here to research the pilgrimage routes to the Vourukasha Oasis.

...

...This is great, just great. What am I going to do...
