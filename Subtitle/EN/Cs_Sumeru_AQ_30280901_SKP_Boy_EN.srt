1
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,875
This is supposed to be a battle between gods, yet you choose to hide behind a mortal

2
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,250
And now, you're acting like you'd sacrifice yourself for a human...

3
00:01:04,675 --> 00:01:08,700
Are you having fun proving a false sense of heroism to yourself, Buer?

4
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:24,325
The data collection is almost complete

5
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,045
Do you even know how many times you've tried to take my Gnosis from me?

6
00:01:45,125 --> 00:01:47,975
We just concluded the 168th loop

7
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,475
Did you know that, in the effort to create you

8
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:59,800
The people of Sumeru were forced to live through the exact same number of Sabzeruz Festivals and samsara cycles?

9
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:06,250
The power of dreams... When did you use it on me...

10
00:02:19,337 --> 00:02:22,400
You can't even defeat me in a dream

11
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,850
What do you hope to achieve with this little trick?

12
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,650
Come, Traveler, just like before

13
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,850
Allow me to awaken the memories in your dreams

14
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,000
All that battle experience!

15
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:41,550
It's more than that

16
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:45,475
"Compile everyone's wisdom in the name of the archon"

17
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,625
That is the original function of the Akasha

18
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:53,425
I've sent everything that happened just now

19
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:56,275
To the people of Sumeru in the form of knowledge

20
00:02:56,525 --> 00:03:02,025
I've asked them... to help you find a way to defeat the false god

21
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:24,975
Now, all of Sumeru's wisdom is at your disposal

22
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,750
Meaningless tricks won't save you!

23
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,850
Heh... Are you done with your tricks?

24
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,100
Can I finally take this as a real battle between gods?

25
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:16,900
Mm, I'll leave this to you

26
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:20,853
The First Sage of Buer
