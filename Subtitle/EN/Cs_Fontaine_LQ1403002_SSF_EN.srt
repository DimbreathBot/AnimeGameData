1
00:00:00,425 --> 00:00:05,824
The verdict came down: This Melusine is guilty

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,900
The Iudex defended the authority of Fontaine law

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,375
But he did not confiscate the Melusine's medical kit

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,880
And so, the Fortress of Meropide gained a new little doctor

5
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:22,400
She still wore her hood and raincoat

6
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:25,992
Even though it never rained in the Fortress

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:33,625
Perhaps thanks to her human appearance, no one refused her treatment

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,495
She treated more and more patients, and her sentence grew ever shorter

9
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:44,400
Finally, the people of the Fortress could not live without her

10
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:48,519
And though her sentence ended, she did not leave them either

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,919
Then one day, she received an invitation from the outside world

12
00:00:55,925 --> 00:01:01,375
The location seemed familiar, and when she arrived, an old lady was waiting for her

13
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,475
She saw right through the Melusine's disguise, but didn't reveal it

14
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,650
Instead, she asked a question

15
00:01:08,425 --> 00:01:13,025
Tell me, why do you think you gained the respect of so many people

16
00:01:13,287 --> 00:01:15,271
Despite being a Melusine?

17
00:01:16,175 --> 00:01:20,080
Because... I look like a human?

18
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,475
It's been fifty years, Sigewinne

19
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,190
And you haven't aged a day...

20
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:31,750
I think everyone knows you are not human

21
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:36,694
I've finally found you, after all these years

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,312
I still remember, you know. It was you who saved me that night

23
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:51,286
But how? I was no longer a Melusine by then

24
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,214
Does it really matter if you're human or Melusine?

25
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,167
I remembered the warmth of your palm

26
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:06,497
It's quite unmistakable

27
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:13,174
And you know what? It hasn't changed one bit

28
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:17,075
You don't have to hide anymore, Sigewinne

29
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:23,116
These days, everyone wants to make friends with Melusines

30
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,525
And I think that it's all because of you

31
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:33,206
I'm sorry I couldn't say this until now, but...

32
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,390
Thank you, Doctor Melusine
