...In those days, the land was leveled by the northern Hunting Winds, cutting down the unruly frontier folk at the behest of the despotic Knyazes.
And in a bid to seize the power left behind by the heavenly moons, a mad monk who spoke in strange tongues presented a treacherous plot to the Tsar of all fae.
Thus were the Moonchildren, hidden in their mountain forests, scattered, sisters driven by fate down divergent paths.
In the end, even that pretentious lunatic could not break free of the celestial shell, and was consumed by the bedeviled sky at the edge of delusion.

But all this took place before the "paradise" had even come into being,
For at the time, it was no more than a daydream, a fantasy shared by two children beneath the moon's glow.
It was not until many years later, when one of them was executed as a notorious bandit, infamous throughout the nations,
That the other finally realized the true meaning of those words that had been left behind as if by accident.

What followed, we all know.
When the long night fell, the royal court of the north could no longer mind the remote borderlands beyond the snowy plains,
And so the horde of pitch-black beasts tore across the barren land, destroying all traces of past civilization.
It was not until, borrowing power from the priestess of the Moonchildren, the original Torchforger raised that first beam of light,
And in the name of the moon, banished the darkness to those lightless ruins, burying it deep down alongside the nightmare-torn souls.

When all was over, the survivors raised a lighthouse atop the mountains, gazing far out towards the new ruler of Snezhnaya.
To preserve his dear friend's pure, childlike dream, the Torchforger did not shy away from defending it before the Tsaritsa's court.
And though he received the royal edict he sought, he also took upon himself an oath of vigilance and sacrifice;
And thus began the history of the "paradise" known as "Nod-Krai."
