"My dear friend, you who were so wise, yet passed early..."
"Amidst glorious legends lurks the gloom of oblivion,"
"Just as life walks with death, and forgetting is the lover of remembrance."
"If the darkness of death did not threaten it, no life would have any importance."
"If the waves of forgetfulness did not surge against them, there would be no histories worth recording."

In the age long past, the queen of grass and trees once did as her friend had entrusted,
Granting the Khvarena of flowers to the divine bird's form, giving her charge over the defense over a part of the rainforest.
And just as the fate of the fresh flower is to wither, Simurgh's fate was sacrifice.
The nurturer of all things verdant had known this since the night she slept beside the lord of flowers...

"And so the verdant divine bird blossomed into countless Khvarena flowers, scattering across the land like hoopoes..."
"The Khvarena fell upon the pure remains of the Amrita's mistress, and thus was a glimmering sea of flowers born."
"Many spirits dwell in the sea, and they carry the wishes of grass, tree, and dew, cleansing all filth."
"Many spirits dwell in the sea, and they sing of the three mothers â€” of verdure, of sweet dew, and fresh flowers."

One night, the daughter must leave the embrace of the three mothers,
And sacrifice herself, for the impurity of the world grows great...
