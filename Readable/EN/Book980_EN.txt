...The alliance shall never perish... I will not... I cannot let the nation he founded... the realm he dreamt of... perish from this world...

...So long as this city remains permanently sealed, the Abyss cannot break through the walls...

...No matter how things become outside, here shall the kindling of human "hope" ever remain...

...Flesh and blood may slough away, bone and marrow may rot, and even the soul may plummet into a prison from which there is no return, but "hope" alone must never be forsaken... for this was the sole treasure that person left for me...

(The handwriting gets messier from here on out, making it hard to decipher.)
