To comfort his crybaby of a companion, the young hero gave his friend a bird's feather.
This was proof of their shared adventure, of the treasure they found together, and was meant to embolden his comrade.

And became a crownless king at the head of many knights.

Supporting his friend from the shadows, and running affairs of state.

But this was a story from long ago.
So many were lost during the cataclysm.
