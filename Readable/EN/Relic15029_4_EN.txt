Amidst the chaos as thick as lightless dark waters, amidst the sorrows and the partings that followed,
The Director and her sisters set out on a journey to defeat the evil at its source,
And her assistant in turn boarded the ship built for battle, eventually slumbering beneath the waters.

Embarking on a journey beyond normal comprehension in the name of the nymphs.
