1
00:00:00,525 --> 00:00:06,225
In times gone by, one quarreled oft with Guizhong concerning mechanical principles

2
00:00:06,325 --> 00:00:09,600
We each had our ideals, and neither would yield

3
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:12,875
Under the pretext of a social gathering

4
00:00:12,992 --> 00:00:15,296
One invited the impartial Rex Lapis

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,675
To judge the quality of our creations...

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,950
But Rex Lapis declared

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,875
That Guizhong's Obscuro Vulpes Mechanism was superior

8
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:30,625
Though one was too proud to acknowledge it, in one's heart, one knew

9
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,875
That Guizhong was indeed the superior talent in the mechanical arts...

10
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:39,600
As for the story between Guizhong and Streetward Rambler

11
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,673
That begins with a certain bell

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:47,975
In Guizhong's opinion, while mechanisms were no substitute for human composers

13
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:52,200
They were yet capable of producing simple but fine melodies

14
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:57,750
But Streetward Rambler believed music to be an expression of the soul

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,975
An emotional enterprise that could never hope to be replicated by machinery

16
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,675
They argued endlessly, until one asked Rex Lapis to intercede

17
00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:12,900
He confiscated the bell, and designated it for ceremonial use

18
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,325
Thereafter, one would often find them convening in the mountains

19
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:23,450
Discussing music, mechanics, and all the affairs of the mortal world

20
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:29,050
But these good times were not to last

21
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,656
War broke out between the gods, and soon engulfed the Guili Plains

22
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:39,072
Guizhong was overpowered by the enemy, and fell in battle

23
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:47,500
When Streetward Rambler and I arrived at the scene at long last, all that remained among the ruins... was her lifeless body

24
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:51,936
After this, at Streetward Rambler's request

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,352
Rex Lapis granted her the Cleansing Bell for safekeeping

26
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,680
To honor our friend's memory

27
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:04,672
One made a few finishing touches to her ballistic device...

28
00:02:06,784 --> 00:02:12,200
Many Lantern Rites have passed since then... many greetings and goodbyes

29
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,050
Upon what do you gaze? The Guili Plains?

30
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,700
No, it's... everything

31
00:02:29,824 --> 00:02:39,025
We think of human life as like a lantern that's lit one minute and extinguished the next, but are we adepti so different?

32
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:42,700
Perhaps, as dust settles after a storm

33
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,525
We too must one day return to the world below
