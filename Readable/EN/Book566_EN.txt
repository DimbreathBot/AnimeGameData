Boss:
I have yet to complete my business, so I won't be back for a while. Should you have any new ideas and want to drag the boys into new shenanigans, hold your horses first. I'll help you organize matters once I get back.
I met a kid while harvesting Lavender Melons. He's articulate and well-mannered, and he loves beetle battles. He even has lots of friends in that department.
Having heard that you're also an avid beetle brawler, the kid was quite eager to meet you. He even said that he'd consider joining the Arataki Gang if you turned out to be better than him at beetle fights. I gave him the addresses of some of your usual haunts so that he can find you himself.
By my estimations, you should have met up by now, so have fun... Just remember to eat your meals on time.
I'll repeat myself again: just relax and stick to beetle battles for now! Don't drag the gang around on some wild adventure or anything!
