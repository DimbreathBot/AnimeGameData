From today, all work related to the Geode Mine Shaft has been suspended, and the connecting paths have been sealed.
If you require one of the connecting paths to be opened for official Fortress business, you must operate the drive valve only under the supervision of a technical expert to prevent accidents.

Drive Valve Operations and Safety Manual
1. The drive valve can be used to rotate, open, and close the connecting paths for each area.
2. The drive valve is controlled via both the Core Gear Drive (non-removable) and the <color=#00E1FFFF>Gear Drivetrain (removable)</color>.
3. The non-removable Core Gear Drive controls the central room, while the Gear Drivetrain controls the direction of each connecting path.
4. When operating, take note that <color=#00E1FFFF>when the direction indicated by the Core Gear Drive is opposite to that indicated by the Gear Drivetrain, the path indicated by the Core Gear Drive will be opened</color>.
5. When all 4 Gear Drivetrains are uninstalled, the drive valve will automatically terminate operation.

The display indications for opening each connecting path are as follows:

Additionally, a new locking device has been deployed in the Geode Mine Shaft. To prevent operational mishaps, the research terminal's energy storage device has been temporarily removed.
Unauthorized access by non-essential personnel is prohibited. Violators will be held responsible for their actions.
