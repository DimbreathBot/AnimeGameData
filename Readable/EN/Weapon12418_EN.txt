The image of the Windblume has been lost amidst the flowing winds of time,
In times of peace, it has become synonymous with love and gladness.
Sometimes, even the forged weapons that are to be wielded for conquest and victory,
Are adorned with such flowers following the commissioner's or forger's wish.
It seems that this blade was custom-made by someone for their beloved.

"Iron blades fail to slash it, neither can imprisonment of stones confine it."
"The wind has no fear of future, only constantly flowing in its direction."
The nameless shepherd who belonged not to the church silently told of stories of the wind,
And presented the "flowers" to them in whose eyes the light yet shone.

If the noble descendants had all but forgotten their original oath, if the conceited silence rose to popularity,
Or if the principle of the blood stood against the flowing wind, the legend of trees and flowers would be forbidden.
In that era, numerous flowers blossomed in places not favored by people.
The flowers were swept away by the wind, yet left an instant of glorious charm in the bleak world.

"In the shadow cast by the tower of the past, in the alleys and streets of today,"
"In the smallest corners, the flowers are still blooming with the faintest glow."
The nameless shepherd who did not hail from the palace silently told of the flowers' stories.

He said: "Today, Ludi Harpastum has been taken away by the noble."
But did you know that, in the ruins where mighty winds once swept, there used to be blooming wild flowers over hill and dale?
Those flowers were not the common kind. The stronger the wind blew, the sturdier those flowers' root would grow, and the more they flourished.
The day when the kingdom was dotted with those flowers would be the day when the tower finally fell down.
