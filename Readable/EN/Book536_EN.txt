To Lieutenant Ruslan Snezhevich:
...Make arrangements for our Sumpter Beast train according to orders. Transport the intelligence we finished organizing the previous day in the desert, the research materials, and other items in waves to the southern harbor, and hand them over to our contact within 15 days.
...This information must not be leaked: Go make a comfy little nest for my Gerardo in the highest-priority Sumpter Beast train without delay! Make sure you also prep some canned food and water!
...Anyway, Rusya, I applied for high water privileges for you, so don't let me catch you stinking when you come and find me again.

Fatui Desert Expedition Investigation Team Security Overseer,
Captain Zoya Snezhevna
