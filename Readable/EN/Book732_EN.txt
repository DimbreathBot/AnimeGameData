I finally received my first mission: to get money off some guy named Rocher.
That old dog's got no shame, refusing to repay his debts like that. I went out there and socked him twice before he coughed up a pile of junk.
The only thing in there that looked like it could be worth anything was this locket. It looked like a woman's... Surely not his wife's, right? Unbelievable.
Who in their right mind would marry a guy like that?
