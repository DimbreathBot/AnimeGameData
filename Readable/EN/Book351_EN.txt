(An old notebook. Someone has written in it with neat handwriting.)
I don't know if anyone will ever read this, but...
Unfortunately, this is my last testament!
To sum things up, I got trapped in this room while adventuring on this island. Actually, there are loads of rooms on this island that can lock people up. I thought I could rely on my wits to break myself out of here like what I did in the last secret chamber, but alas.
But when I really think about it, I was only able to unlock the mechanism last time thanks to some notes that were left behind. It had nothing to do with my wits, really. Looks like I'm just not cut out to be an adventurer...
I ran out of food, and then I ran out of ideas. I'm about to be done for.

That's when I thought of that little tuxedo cat from Mondstadt, Bella... Oh, sweet Bella! Whenever I'd go out to eat, you'd always step all over my plate, tipping it over. I'm afraid I won't be able to go to the restaurant anymore... I wonder if you will feel lonely without me around...?
"That human whose plate I always stepped on hasn't come by in a while, meow..."
Is that what you're thinking, Bella? ...*sigh* Probably not, huh? Haha.

Speaking of restaurants, the last time I went to one, I had Sweet Madame.
I've been to so many places and eaten so many great dishes, but might I be so bold as to say that Mondstadt's Sweet Madame is the best in the world?
Saying that, my stomach is grumbling so much it's practically singing a tenor solo.
*sigh* If only I could have another bite of Sweet Madame... Just one bite would do...
