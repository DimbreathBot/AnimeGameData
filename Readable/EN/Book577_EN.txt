No one can confidently say that they will never get lost, but as long as their wish to guide and help others does not waver, they will become a ship that can traverse the waves eternally.

I didn't perform any divination before writing this letter, but I have a feeling that I will witness the truth behind the prophecy together with you all.

So if you need me, just call on me at my place. I'll be there.
