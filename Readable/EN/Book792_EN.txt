As to how to decipher the stone tablets and bronze slates... We hit a massive roadblock right from the start... Most of the texts previously discovered in older Golden Troupe ruins and legacy copies we got from collections were all from Fontaine's early nation-building stage or later. As such, most of these texts were written in Fontainian script... This time, we unearthed a great number of antediluvian bronze slates and stone tablets, which all use ancient Remurian script...
...
Regarding Remurian characters... They seem to be some form of phonography, of which we currently only recognize a single digit amount... For the longest time, we treated them like simple musical notes, and undertook many trials on that basis without any progress. As such, we hit an impasse in our research...
...Until, after being reminded by Mr. Erich, we found... in an ancient copy preserved in the Institute of Natural Philosophy... made progress in deciphering the documents... It's the first step in a long journey, but we have already surpassed all previous scholars of the esoteric...
...
Regarding morality... While this might conjure up empty talk of ethics today, it had more practical significance to the ancients... Complete mastery over the body by one's will was considered the consummation of human virtue, a pinnacle that only gods and the rarest of mortals could come close to attaining... Following moral decay, the will became shackled to bodily form... Willpower withered, and humanity became entirely enslaved to their flesh... The ancients would see this as a separation from civilization's communal body, an eternal sundering from music and the divine, becoming next-of-kin to the beasts...

Regarding the concepts of spirit and will... Just as the people of Sumeru had specialized terminology to illustrate different stages of plant growth, Fontainians had more than twenty words describing water's various aspects. However, the ancients' study and differentiation of the spirit reached heights that we ourselves found challenging to attain... While, for the most part, it was divided into memory, wishes, soul, and persona, a spirit's qualities still carried complex distinctions... Among these, the state that came closest to the perfect freedom that divinities possessed was named "True Will"... The detachment of human will with such meticulous research as a jumping-off point... Perhaps it was through this power that the ancients achieved transcendence from the physical realm. Despite this remarkable achievement, they were unable to escape their fate, which appeared preordained...
...
Regarding "Fortuna"... Myth, proverbs, and poetry are all that we have compiled so far in connection to "Fortuna." These findings deviate significantly from initial expectations... At best, they could be described as vague inferences and a priori assertions, bereft of quantifiability or scientific rigor. They appear exceedingly rudimentary and primitive when compared to the world-formula. Furthermore...
...As expected, this seems to be an attempt to make up for some shortfall. The ancients even made no small amount of errors in their selection of materials. This was unavoidable... Aside from analysis of the will and the "Seal of Chymical Marriage," there was hardly any utility to be found... When faced with the fact that the ancients were deceived by such falsehoods for a thousand years, one can only wonder if it was a matter of faith or folly...
