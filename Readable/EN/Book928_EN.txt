Angakuk, Angakuk.
Where will I hear that voice from beneath the earth...
Or a rumbling from even deeper underground. If you will it so, send forth an envoy.
Before dawn's first light, we shall take up arms to quell the Night Kingdom's unrest.
When I am ready, Angakuk, make your warrior manifest, Angakuk.
