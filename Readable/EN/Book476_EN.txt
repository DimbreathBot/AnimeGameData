"In three days I shall die, and the kingdom shall be plunged into unending chaos."

(The other inscriptions on this slate are very unclear and hard to read. It seems that inscriptions from different periods and in different styles have been layered over each other, altering one another in the process.)

(The words inscribed here are fragmented, their content a mess.)
...After Shah Ramshahr... death, his young son Artaxir took the throne as... Artaxir died... and Minister (here "Traitor" has been appended on top) Turan Khagan ruled as regent...
...The bandit Turan Khagan was destroyed, and his three sons were... by... executed... Humayun and Shah Ramshahr's princess... married... and so was known as King Humayun Gurkan.
...In the... year... Humayun Gurkan was slain in the Jinn Uprising, and was decapitated at Saleh... Within a short time, thirty kings came to be allies across the land, and within a few years, they had all perished...
...Garshāsp destroyed all the bandits, and thus did the kings bow to him, naming him Muazzam Khagan, Khagan of Khagans. He abandoned Gurabad, and set up... as the capital...
...Garshāsp Khagan fell, and the capital burned for seven days, destroy... the people... fled to Tulaytullah the Sapphire City. Some became servants, others craftsmen, and others entertainers...

...

May the lord of the blazing sands save these mortal realms, and may his favor restore us to... those years.
