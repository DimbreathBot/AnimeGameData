The war has started. The research on the "Phlogiston Converter" has been completed. The time I spent here, though brief, was nothing if not nostalgic.
Lord Kukulkan ordered us to conduct our experiments on sites situated outside the Sacred Mountain. Perhaps it was to protect the position of dissenters like us.
But in the face of real danger, all factions should put aside their differences, unite, and fight together... I can only pray that the relationship between Lord Kukulkan and the Chamber of Deliberation can be mended somehow...
...
There wasn't enough time. We couldn't retrieve most of the materials. We could only return to the Sacred City with our experimental data, but it'll be alright. I'm certain of our victory. When that day arrives, we'll just bring these things back to the Sacred City of Tollan, one by one.
...
The "Secret Source Servant" and the "Secret Source Dragon Idol"... Well, we've set up periodic defense mechanisms to keep this place safe.
I'm leaving this place in your capable hands, my trusty constructs.
...
They don't come with "true" emotion modules, so why do I feel like they're sad to see me go? Haha... Look at me, projecting my fantasies onto non-living objects. A researcher's greatest folly.
But it's okay... It's okay, little ones. Just wait for me to return victorious from the war...
I won't be long. I'll come home soon.
