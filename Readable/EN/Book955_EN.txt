Month: Unknown. Day: Unknown. Weather: Can't tell from where I am now...

...It's completely different from what I imagined. I didn't expect the Tonatiuh to be such a desolate place. I can almost see what the Python King must've felt in those final moments...

...Still, there's Pyrophosphorite everywhere. Does that mean this is the origin of all the Pyrophosphorite that adventurers get? But who could take it from here and give it to them...

...So that's it. It's only thanks to Coco that I now understand the true nature of the "Jade of Return"...

...The machine that could save Natlan, but not us... So many heroes have been sacrificed for this... So why draw us here...? I get it, you can't touch it, can you? That's why you need our hands, need Coco's...

...But even if it's a fake Sacred Grail, it doesn't matter if it's ██, or Aunt Liriwu, anyone who embarks on the journey is a true hero!...

...This is the last fragment of Pyrophosphorite left in the land... Was it your plan for me to bring it here? I guess that's fine, though, since this way, nobody else'll be tricked by you...

...I won't let you get it! Because we're going to stop your plan, right here!
