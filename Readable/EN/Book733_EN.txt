Seems like something happened today. Directors 2 through 41 were all taken away. Supposedly, The Steambird blew the lid off our business and got the Marechaussee Phantom involved.
Luckily, I'm new, so I'm safe for now. But I don't get it â€” aren't we just in the regular old cutlery business?
Whatever, it doesn't matter. To repay the boss's kindness, my first order of business is to pay that paper a little visit.
