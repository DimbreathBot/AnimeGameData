Most Respected Podporuchik,

I express here my unequalled guilt, regret, and self-reproachment for my grave misdeed â€” having trapped you in the barrier for an entire night on account of my carelessness! I should have upheld meticulousness and adherence to duty when showing the rookie soldier around, and thus set a good example, but my flagrant carelessness, combined with the new recruit Riku's over-enthusiastic, self-taught usage of the recon bots to meddle with the settings of the authorization terminal, thus causing the accident. I have betrayed your trust in me, and the Tsaritsa's expectations of us all! I have deeply reflected on my actions and strictly reprimanded Riku. Even now, I keep a watchful eye on him.

As part of carrying out your order to "kick Dima back to start over from the rookie training class," I shall lock myself inside the barrier and observe the Tassel Jellies for an entire night. Just as they, in their last moments of life, shall fly up into the skies and return with their youth renewed, I shall use this opportunity to regain my footing, rebuilding and reshaping my person in the likeness of myself as a trainee, fresh and filled with passion for our great work.

Finally, I pledge to be sharper, smarter, and wiser when any future incident occurs. I will not repeat the same mistake!
