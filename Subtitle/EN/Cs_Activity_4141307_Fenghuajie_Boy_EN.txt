00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:08,119
The Windblume Festival originated in the "Crown of the North, the City of Freedom"

2
00:00:08,825 --> 00:00:12,675
We gotta bring enough supplies this time, otherwise you'll go hungry again!

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,473
So, if you're asking me...

4
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,450
On official business? We're grateful to you

5
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,822
As are we to you

6
00:00:22,944 --> 00:00:25,700
Funny, we haven't gotten together for a meal in a while

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,257
It's been so busy lately...

8
00:00:27,257 --> 00:00:29,578
What should we do, on this day?

9
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:31,158
Mr. Albedo!

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,610
How is the research going?

11
00:00:33,976 --> 00:00:35,369
We've had a few issues...

12
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:37,642
Have a look at this. Now, we think...

13
00:00:38,142 --> 00:00:41,000
Of course, any good tavern offers bar snacks

14
00:00:41,557 --> 00:00:42,235
Really?

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,888
How should we do it? Who should we do it for?

16
00:00:47,953 --> 00:00:50,861
Quietly? Or boldly?

17
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:56,273
Make the first move? Or trust to chance?

18
00:00:57,055 --> 00:00:59,621
Aaaah... Look out!

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,066
Sorry, so sorry!

20
00:01:05,778 --> 00:01:07,599
My answer is this:

21
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:12,449
So long as we can both share fond memories, it doesn't matter

22
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,825
Let the heart decide
