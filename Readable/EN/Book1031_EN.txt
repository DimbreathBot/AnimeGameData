...When will he understand that if he keeps treating his own kin as nothing more than insects, then those of them who share the same burning fire of knowledge that he does will always view him as their foe...

...Even now, despite having failed once already, he persists in pursuing his ludicrous plans. The aberration he cultivated did not succeed in taking the throne of humankind, as he had so wished...

...That would make for an intriguing game indeed. Show me, my poor brother, your ambition. How far will your path take you...
