<center>I, Aetius, and my sister, Placidia, did not perish of illness,
but fell resisting the traitorous Dragonborn as they came to the city gates.
Legio VI had not a single deserter amongst its ranks, nor did any disgrace the name of our benefactrix. We guard this palace.
Just as we followed Euergetia to pacify the northern barbarian border, and deliver unto them civilization.
We choose civilization and death. There is no greater honor than to die defending civilization.
Play, comrades, play the grand verse! For all that is noble and glorious, and in the name of our benefactrix.</center>
