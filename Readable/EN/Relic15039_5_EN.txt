The air was thick with the scent of blood, as if signaling the return of the great war by which the earth had been scorched.
With a great mournful wail, that army of spirits flew across the pitch blackness of the night sky.
According to the folk tales spread through the countryside, they were said to be a demonic host from another world seeking a harvest of souls.
Others believed them to be the lingering phantoms of that ancient nightmare.

This was the calamity that the people of the borderlands refer to as the "Wild Hunt."
If it had been no more than a summer storm, ravaging the sky with thunder and lightning,
It might have seemed a small mishap to those accustomed to a life of adventure.
But when that tempest, the likes of which had not been seen for a century, poured down upon the earth like black-blood rain,
Only then did the people realize that these terrifying legends, which had been passed down by their ancestors,
Were not mere stories meant to frighten children, but born instead of a terror that coursed through their very veins.

But in the end, it was a terror that someone had to face, lighting the way for the souls wandering through the boundless dark.
A black-feathered flock of crows moved between the realms of light and shadow, led by one who stood against the light.
His sword he silently raised, the face reflected in its sheen as sharp and unyielding as the blade itself.
Onward pressed the oath-bound legion, though they knew they were as moths to a flame, marching onto that battlefield from whom none would return.

...
At the end of the path, only the one who held the dark blade still stood.
He knew that deep within the forest lurked the foul force by which the "Wild Hunt" had been summoned forth.
Just a little more, a little further, and he would have saved the land he had sworn to protect.
Lost in his thoughts, he failed to notice that his body had already been torn asunder,
And that the warning bell he carried rang out hissing amidst the tearing of blood and black muck.
Perhaps frightened by its unsettling chime, the carrion feeders around him faltered, frozen in their tracks.
Thus was he left to walk alone in the abyss, to fulfill an as-yet unfulfilled oath...

As many years went by, a new addition was woven into the folklore of the land:
That, whenever mournful bells toll, it is a sign that the one who swore to hunt down the Wild Hunt is approaching.
