Every student in the school knew that the strict instructor was a serious soldier.
But every week, there would always be a day or two when the instructor would wear this yellow flower brooch on his chest.
The smile on the instructor's face would always bring the students a sense of relief.
For when the instructor wore the yellow flower brooch, it meant that they could take a day off and go home.
Once his boisterous students had finally gone, the instructor would visit a silent graveyard.
There, after a moment of silence, he would pay his respects to the familiar names carved on the tombstones.
