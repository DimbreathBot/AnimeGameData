♪~♪~♪~ Tecuhtli, there are three things you have to pay attention to ♪~♪~♪~
♪~♪~♪~ Number one! Black Boar Rekis is probably sending someone to grab the Asha, so make sure to get rid of them! ♪~♪~♪~
♪~♪~♪~ Number two! Icahua might be lurking nearby. He's a sharp, sneaky shot, but don't let him do you in! ♪~♪~♪~
♪~♪~♪~ Number three! Number two is the most important! ♪~♪~♪~
