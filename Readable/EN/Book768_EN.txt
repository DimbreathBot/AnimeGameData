I think I have a fever and my old stomach troubles have returned. But nobody has given me any medicine.
I suppose I am more fortunate than Crecy... the pain keeps her awake all night.
I suppose they think that anything goes so long as the experimental subjects can be used up before they die...
It is so damp here. I have given her my blanket.
So cold, so cold. So cold.
As long as one persists, all things will pass.
There will be a reward for hard work.
I like to tell them such things.
But it is I who am losing my grip.
