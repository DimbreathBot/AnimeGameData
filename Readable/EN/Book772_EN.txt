Dear Katheryne,
As a member of the Adventurers' Guild, I know the Guild is always on the lookout for new talent. During our adventure in Erinnyes, Paimon and I made the acquaintance of Ms. Penny. We believe her to be an ambitious, promising young person worthy of the Adventurers' Guild's consideration. She is passionate about becoming an adventurer. Due to her young age, however, she currently lacks a concrete understanding of the life she will lead on that path.
Looking after and guiding young adventurers is the duty and obligation of us senior adventurers, so we're certain that the Guild would be happy to give her all the guidance she needs. If, following an extended period of observation, the Guild deems her qualified to become an adventurer, we would all be delighted.
Sincerely,
{NICKNAME} and Paimon
