A chainsaw favored by workers of the past to cut through keels and pipes.
Its simple and sturdy structure made maintenance and swapping parts a breeze.
Grab the handle tightly with both hands, and even hard steel will be split before you.
This all-powerful tool was once the hallmark of progress.

As the urban areas of Fontaine grew, the light of order drove away the shadows.
It was largely due to this convenient tool that the sewers eventually became the Fleuve Cendre.

The workers' abundant diligence and tenacity occasionally won them the right to live on the surface,
And at other times turned their underground watery realm into a residence just as beautiful as the world above.

Unlike dock swords and exploration drills, these chainsaws were not banned.
This was because such chainsaws played an irreplaceable role in the early production of clockwork meka.
Later on, a massive clockwork meka factory was constructed in an absolutely safe area outside the city,
And those who could skillfully utilize these saws were gradually washed away alongside their weapons by the torrent of progress.
