...Our prayers to the Goddess of Flowers have borne fruit. Her envoy came to us in a moonbeam, granting us life-saving medicine and clean water...
...She called herself Liloupar, born of the lilies, and she gave a final warning to us, the people of the Goddess...

...She embraced my daughter in her sleep before leaving in the morning, and did not touch our offerings... And now my daughter's fever has abated...
Fortunately, the illness was not a serious one, and would not affect work the next day, for His Majesty Parvezravan's mercy does not extend to the seriously ill...
...
...At moonrise, she warned us that the water from the canal may carry disease. Something terrible has happened to the water source at Mt. Damavand...
...The others must be warned...

...His Majesty Parvezravan has built a new palace and factory, and the pay is high indeed. With that, we should be able to pay our delinquent taxes, but we must go to live at the work site. And if I go, who shall take care of my wife and daughter...?
...Is the water there clean?
