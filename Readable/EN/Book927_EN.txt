Angakuk, Mighty Wayob, collective consciousness and guardian of the past, will without form or thought...
My whole life have I spent in pursuit... that silent... place deeper than the deepest valley...
Now my life nears its end, Angakuk, otherwise known as the will of the Wayob...
Let the birds carry me away, just as they would a branch...
Carry me away, to the place where all souls become one, to be reunited with my friends.
