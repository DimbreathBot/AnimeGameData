...This time, I've been commissioned to try to find a local order and obtain information about something known as "The Sign of Apaosha." I must say that remuneration seems quite outsized when compared with the mission content. I hope I won't get caught up in any trouble...
...I reached the entrance to the Temir Mountains with the help of an Eremite mercenary, but he refused to continue onward, saying that this was the "border of a war." Must be some sort of desert-dweller superstition.
