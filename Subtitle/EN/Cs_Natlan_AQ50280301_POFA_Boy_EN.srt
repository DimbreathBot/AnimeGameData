1
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,250
If you so yearn for the agony of death

2
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:48,000
Then bow down to its true appearance!

3
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,475
You who traversed the stars

4
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,875
Fear not

5
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:24,175
Natlan has placed its trust in you

6
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,700
Descender

7
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,950
Ignite your fire

8
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,775
The hope that burns within!
