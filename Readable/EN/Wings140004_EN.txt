"A gust of wind would be really good just about now."
Thus sighed the adventurer trekking through the seemingly boundless wilderness.
The sounds of his lament ascended to the lofty children of the skies, who reside in the towering heavens above. One of the children, hearing the adventurer's plea, began to wonder how to bring the breeze to this person in need.
"It can be done, but you must set out from the shores in the east. You must then hike through the ravines of mountains and hills, and wend your way along the sandy banks of springs and rivers. Only after a journey of insurmountable distance will you finally reach him."

So it departed from the eastern shores, embarking on a journey of its own.
Along the way, it found some dandelion seeds that desired to travel, so it carried the seeds for a distance along the way.
Then it met nestlings who had just hatched and desired to soar through the air, so it lifted their delicate wings.
It then happened upon some village elders who were too old to prepare grain for themselves, so it tarried for a while, spinning the sails of their windmills.
As it came to serve others and selflessly cared for the lands, it began to slowly materialize, gradually taking the form of a person.
When it finally came to the end of its path and met the stranded adventurer,
it was no longer the gust of wind that the adventurer had first hoped for.

"A gust of wind would be really good just about now."
So it then accompanied that first adventurer on his journey across the lands...

â€” "This is a lovely parable from a saint of the Church of Favonius. The moral of the story is to always be ready to help those in need and willing to serve others. In recognition of your kind and charitable deeds, I bestow upon you this wind glider."
