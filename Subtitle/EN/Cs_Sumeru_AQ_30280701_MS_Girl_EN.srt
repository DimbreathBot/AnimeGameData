1
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,675
Who would have thought...

2
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,050
The world would be so eager for my "birth"

3
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:36,750
I remember you

4
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,025
Buer, the God of Wisdom

5
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,325
And standing beside you... the Traveler

6
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,725
Is he all-knowing and powerful now like Greater Lord Rukkhadevata?

7
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:51,692
No, I can't feel the same kind of divinity I felt from the Greater Lord

8
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:57,033
It seems that the sages didn't get the chance to infuse the Divine Knowledge Capsules into him

9
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:58,850
But even still...

10
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,380
He has undoubtedly become a true "god" now

11
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:05,151
So we're too late?

12
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:09,650
The Balladeer has already... already become a god...?

13
00:01:09,975 --> 00:01:11,398
"The Balladeer"

14
00:01:11,825 --> 00:01:13,965
A long bygone title

15
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:16,775
When my spirit ascended to divinity

16
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,750
I felt as if I had existed for the same number of epochs as heaven and earth

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,600
Looking back

18
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,975
The existence of what once called itself "Kunikuzushi" appears infinitely small

19
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,527
And ugly
