The deeper we dug, the stronger that indescribable, nauseating stench became. Perhaps it was due to the pervasive dampness and fungi, for those pale molds and indescribably strange mineral deposits all seemed to emit a toxic odor, but that was not the only source of unease here. To begin with, (...) felt that there was something "unlucky" about this place, but even she did not offer up any explanations even more far-fetched than that at the time. But as the work progressed, a craftsman from (...) suddenly lost his wits — screaming, laughing, crying, and all the while babbling incoherently about how he had seen an almost impossibly large, hideous, and swollen black silhouette in the watery depths; and of how it had shrieked a terrifying, profane song, commanding him to kneel down before the "Master." The supervisor took him away, but a sense of unease had already begun to spread among the workers. The surging foam and swirling of the foul water could be explained as regular elemental phenomena, but those intermittent sounds and whispers... even I could not find any reasonable explanation for those.

From behind those ancient walls — or perhaps from beneath them, though I could not say for sure — I could hear a sound, unmistakably clear yet at the same time faint, furtive, and muffled, as if something was scurrying through the walls.

Yet those terrifying rustling sounds continued to reverberate through the dead of night, jarring me into the confusion of half-wakefulness from what was uneasy sleep to begin with.

Our supervisor reassured us that she herself had not heard anything unusual, attributing our hallucinations to lack of rest. She even applied for extra grain rations for us, out of sympathy for our plight. Yet the fear that had spread among the laborers was so intense that...
