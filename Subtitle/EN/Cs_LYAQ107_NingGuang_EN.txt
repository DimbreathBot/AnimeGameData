1
00:00:03,125 --> 00:00:07,950
They say that when Lady Ningguang ponders important affairs

2
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:11,375
She retreats to her Jade Chamber

3
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:15,375
With none but her three closest confidantes in tow

4
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:20,019
Why brings she these trusted three?

5
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:23,814
To sift through sources, dig through documents

6
00:00:23,814 --> 00:00:25,814
Looking for information

7
00:00:27,425 --> 00:00:30,339
Piece by piece, facts and figures

8
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:32,925
Paint a picture on the walls of the chamber...

9
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,975
But well before the wall is filled

10
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:39,775
Lady Ningguang's mind is made up

11
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,545
Having made her call

12
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:46,275
She has every last document shredded

13
00:00:46,525 --> 00:00:51,080
And fwoosh! She scatters the shavings out her window

14
00:00:52,778 --> 00:00:54,725
Ah, look at them!

15
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:56,733
How they billow in the wind

16
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:59,825
Like a sudden swirling blizzard!

17
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,925
As the fragments fall

18
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,625
Traces of text

19
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:07,750
Flicker before the eyes of the merchants of Liyue

20
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:10,775
Like ink stains in white snow

21
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,916
The saying goes:

22
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:15,475
The rarest treasures in the land

23
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,550
Are the words brought by the paper snow

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,900
For the words of the Tianquan have the power to move mountains

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,925
And all throughout the land know it
