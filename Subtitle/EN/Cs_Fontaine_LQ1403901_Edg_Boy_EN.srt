1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,575
The accord is the basis of perfume-making

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,100
The product in its most primitive form

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,400
Ambergris mixed with cedarwood

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:11,264
Rounded out with a base note of agarwood...

5
00:00:14,272 --> 00:00:17,925
...This is... the scent of leather?

6
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:22,050
Exactly. We're unable to extract essential oils from leather

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,975
But by combining other raw materials, we can recreate its essence

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,450
That is the purpose of an accord

9
00:00:29,275 --> 00:00:33,900
Does that mean, you can recreate any scent in the whole world?

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,050
Haha, I'm afraid not

11
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:40,384
Certain fragrances in this world

12
00:00:40,775 --> 00:00:43,850
Are simply one of a kind

13
00:00:45,675 --> 00:00:48,625
That quality is what draws people in

14
00:00:48,825 --> 00:00:51,275
And fuels their obsessions...

15
00:00:53,224 --> 00:00:57,128
If I wear "Auguste" to the ball, I'll also be "one of a kind"!

16
00:00:57,128 --> 00:00:58,750
Our competitor already got their hands on it? We're falling behind!

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,800
It doesn't matter how much it costs. I have to buy something better!
Perfume is all anyone's talking about. I have to buy some soon...
Who cares about the message? Fork over the Mora and it's yours, am I right?

18
00:01:05,475 --> 00:01:09,000
This fragrance... will be "one of a kind" no more

19
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:12,169
"Myths" can be deconstructed

20
00:01:12,553 --> 00:01:14,050
"Miracles" can be recreated

21
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,901
All it takes is skill, experience

22
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:21,047
Limitless exploration, and a little patience

23
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:31,049
...The only thing left is determining where the real "Auguste" is hidden

24
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:36,791
...Pretending to be attacked means he's not free to move around

25
00:01:37,456 --> 00:01:40,132
"Auguste" must be hidden within reach...

26
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:43,000
...Paimon took a peek through the window earlier

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,129
And his house was packed with flowers...

28
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,524
The curator commissioned a flower pot from Kshahrewar

29
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,700
Capable of retaining heat and moisture...

30
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:56,850
...Perfumes are as beautiful as flowers, and equally as delicate

31
00:01:57,425 --> 00:01:58,200
When stored

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,100
You must take care to control the temperature

33
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,300
And keep them away from direct sunlight...

34
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:04,888
Did you get all that, Emilie?

35
00:02:05,737 --> 00:02:08,873
...Mhm, I got it

36
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:29,991
Did you hear? Someone was attacked again last night!

37
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:39,350
So... Sylvain is dead, is that right?

38
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:44,455
...Yes, Master
