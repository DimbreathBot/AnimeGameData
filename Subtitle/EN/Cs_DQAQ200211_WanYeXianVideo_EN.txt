1
00:00:00,975 --> 00:00:02,925
He was once a good friend of mine

2
00:00:03,475 --> 00:00:06,368
One day, he asked me about a sword art of which he had heard

3
00:00:06,368 --> 00:00:07,834
The Musou no Hitotachi

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,750
I told him

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,925
It can only be witnessed when "divine punishment" is administered

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,800
It is the pinnacle of the Raiden Shogun's skill

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,500
A symbol of ultimate power

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,250
But he replied: "There must be one who can withstand it"

9
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,800
"There will always be those who dare to brave the lightning's glow"

10
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:35,875
Then, the Vision Hunt Decree arrived

11
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:39,800
Peoples' aspirations were stripped away

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,521
As the Raiden Shogun began to construct her ideal of "eternity"

13
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:48,125
While I was fleeing from place to place

14
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:51,600
I heard that my friend had challenged the Vision Hunters

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,200
To a duel before the throne

16
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,833
A solemn yet brutal challenge

17
00:00:58,986 --> 00:01:04,759
The defeated face divine punishment, while the victors gain a second chance

18
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:08,845
Perhaps he thought he of all people should make a stand

19
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,000
Coming face to face with the Musou No Hitotachi

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,448
Was all that he truly desired, after all

21
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,307
When I arrived at Tenshukaku

22
00:01:18,307 --> 00:01:19,633
The duel was over

23
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:21,660
I heard his sentence of divine punishment

24
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,675
His severed blade hitting the ground

25
00:01:24,825 --> 00:01:27,900
Perhaps that was the glory he had yearned to witness

26
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:32,517
In his last moments

27
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,025
What expression was on his face?

28
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:38,625
Before I knew it

29
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,275
I had stepped forward and snatched the dying Vision

30
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:43,263
And was running from the scene

31
00:01:43,263 --> 00:01:46,950
All I knew was that I mustn't let his hope which burned so brightly

32
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,100
Become buried among the ice-cold statue of a god
