1
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,417
Klee

2
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,375
Listen

3
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,575
The wind!

4
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:30,550
The Anemo God is coming!

5
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:31,325
Alright!

6
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,517
Take this

7
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:03,225
Crush it, and place it on the fracture

8
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,100
Listen, missy

9
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,250
Promise me

10
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,350
You'll live on

11
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,300
This is where you must stay

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,000
You are our only hope

13
00:01:19,475 --> 00:01:20,675
Forgive me

14
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:22,175
Kaeya

15
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:30,775
Good

16
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:31,725
Very good

17
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,150
That's my boy

18
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:36,075
I will always be proud of you

19
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,700
After all the time we spent on it

20
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,200
The wine still isn't ready

21
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:52,525
May as well leave it for our son

22
00:01:52,675 --> 00:01:53,550
"Razor"

23
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,725
What do you think of that name?

24
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,675
Ooh!

25
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,725
An adventurer's name

26
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,500
Yes

27
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,575
I like it

28
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,716
Raaazooor

29
00:02:02,525 --> 00:02:03,380
Razor

30
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,686
Come on!
