1
00:00:06,525 --> 00:00:09,875
I'm honored to be here on the Iridescence Tour stage!

2
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:14,100
Alright, without further ado, I'm Xinyan, this is Hu Tao...

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,350
And this is a li'l something called:

4
00:00:20,075 --> 00:00:22,075
"The Blaze Lilies!"

5
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:37,550
I'm up here blazin' trails through the midnight sky, lightin' up the world below

6
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:43,600
And when the crowds all hear my voice, they'll meet the spirit of rock n' roll

7
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:48,100
Let's go! / Hey you, butterfly / You too, buzzin' by / Guidin' your way / To the afterlife

8
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,325
Openin' the path without a fright / Oh!

9
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,050
I'll light the fire / Watch it blaze / 'cross the universe

10
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:56,775
I'll spit my rhymes / Watch your step / Or you'll get burned

11
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,825
Does anyone have any plans tomorrow?

12
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,425
With another year behind us, I think we deserve a celebration of our own

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,525
My treat, interested?

14
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,400
The Tianquan footing the bill? I can't miss out on that

15
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,125
...

16
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:11,500
Master, Master! Listen!

17
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,250
May the year ahead be a blessed one

18
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:30,850
I believe it shall be

19
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,225
Master, the Xiao Lanterns... I...

20
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:43,850
Ha!

21
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,175
Elementary

22
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,325
One shall fashion for you a Xiao Lantern the likes of which the world has never seen

23
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:55,350
Then, you must take it to Liyue Harbor, to display its magnificence for all

24
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,025
Listen! That must be Madame Ping!
