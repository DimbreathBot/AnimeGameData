1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,000
Hmm? It's dark in here!

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,775
Wait here, Mr. Morris

3
00:00:03,775 --> 00:00:06,775
I think the light switch should be somewhere over here...

4
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:10,100
...Ugh, why did I have to get roped into this...

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,625
*gasp*! Wh—What was that!?

6
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:22,225
Who's there? Get me out!!! Get me outta here!!!

7
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:26,575
Did you really think you'd get away, Morris?

8
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:34,675
You've got the wrong guy!

9
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:37,525
It wasn't me, I—I'm not the killer!

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,725
You know, Elisa died a far more heroic death than this

11
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:45,304
She fought your assassin to the end

12
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:48,329
To save the child she had hidden beneath the floorboards

13
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:54,900
That is Elisa's pendant

14
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:57,434
The one with a photo of you two inside

15
00:00:58,075 --> 00:00:59,325
The one you gave her

16
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,950
Ring any bells?

17
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,775
I—It's a fake

18
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:03,575
It has to be! There's no way—

19
00:01:03,775 --> 00:01:06,653
...No way your assassin didn't destroy it, you mean?

20
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,508
Did you ever love her, Morris?

21
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:16,325
Or was killing her always the plan?

22
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:18,400
No no no, please, listen to me!

23
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:20,950
I told Elisa to keep us a secret...

24
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:23,150
I paid her plenty for her silence!

25
00:01:23,575 --> 00:01:25,525
I never thought she'd keep the child!

26
00:01:26,081 --> 00:01:27,440
Everything was gonna come out...

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,266
And I had no choice, she forced my hand!

28
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,700
No, I'm begging you...

29
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:34,375
I have money...

30
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,075
Just name your price, please!

31
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:38,050
You can keep your Mora

32
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,925
And you can go to hell

33
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:44,397
... ...?

34
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:48,666
I'm Captain Chevreuse of the Special Patrol

35
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:49,625
Morris

36
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,575
You're under arrest for Elisa's murder

37
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,275
Tch!

38
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,750
You're under arrest, too

39
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,725
Prop Manager Veronique

40
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:21,225
Or perhaps...

41
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:25,325
I should call you... "The Second Musketeer"?

42
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,300
...
