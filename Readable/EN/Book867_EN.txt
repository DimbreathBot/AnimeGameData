<center>Not a single stone nor handful of soil knows where Aurelius, exalted Harmost most noble, lies buried.
His tomb is the vast ocean before you, and he sank to the depths together with his mighty flagship of forty rows of oars.
He who once promoted the great Boethius, he who once pacified countless tribes yet uncivilized for the empire,
He who once played the melodies of ten legions, and who passed order and civilization to those who succeeded his authority.
May Phobos curse the names of the traitors for all eternity, for they have colluded with the cruel, reprobate barbarians, who repaid kindness with treason,
Scuttling the great ship that carried the Harmost north, the endless waves engulfing its shining golden glory.
When civilization crushes savagery once and for all, such brutal barbarism shall be repaid twelve times over.</center>
