<center>"In lofty flight doth Mandarin ducks soar, swimming 'neath the sun, their freedom they adore.
The turtles betwixt water columns doth glide, catfish in schools, together they bide.
The souls of the land, o'er mountain and swamp, creep through the bushes, their spirits to romp.
Bishui is wide and mighty, yet a tortoise it spans, crossing with ease, as one snapper can.
Surveying the world, inspiration doth unfold, sorrow yet smolders within, like tales of old.
The bridge still stands firm, as do boats on the wave, swaying in the wind, lonesome if brave.
Offerings of meat, a hopeful display, nourishing companions, as I wait and pray.
Freely I offer victuals, a feast to extend, friends partake, in providence, we blend."</center>
