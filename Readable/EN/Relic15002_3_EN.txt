A hunter's hat without any blood stains.
In folklore, it belonged to the uncrowned queen of hunters â€” the Viridescent Venerer.

"Never become the foe of the earth and the forest." This was the hunters' rule.
Instead, a hunter should become a silent part of nature.
It is said that a bird once built its nest in this hat.

None could ever bestow a crown upon the queen of hunters,
since the only one superior to her was nature itself.

In the crisis that soon followed, her hunter's hat became
a frightful sight for monsters to behold.
