An ornamental urn made of sapphire, bearing the silver insignia of a noble house.
It is exquisite and elegant, a testament to the aesthetics of the ancient nobles of Mondstadt.

A noble who once ruled over Mondstadt left it behind.
However, the extravagant treasures that once lay inside are now gone.
These luxuries were symbols of the noble's stature,
as well as the confidence, pride, and prosperity of the people of Mondstadt.

Then, the nobles fell prey to power.
They took and they spent without regard for the people.
Luxurious accessories became vanity items.
