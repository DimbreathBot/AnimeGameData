1
00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:05,225
It took three betrayals for me to finally understand:

2
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:10,100
The world is just an elaborate tapestry of lies

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,775
My fury will never be quelled

4
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:20,800
The first to betray me was a god

5
00:00:21,425 --> 00:00:25,570
My creator... my mother

6
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:32,575
Valuing strength above all, she saw no worth in me, and I was discarded

7
00:00:34,725 --> 00:00:36,550
The second was a human

8
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:41,825
My family... my friend

9
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:48,850
Consumed by fear, he saw me as an abomination

10
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,559
The third was one exactly like me

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,300
A hope for the future... a fledgling barely out of the nest

12
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:11,431
Powerless before his mortality, he broke his promise to me

13
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:20,325
Humans... they can't be trusted. And the gods fill me with pure loathing

14
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:27,850
So I said good riddance! I denounce the world and laugh in its face

15
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,725
My chest will never again be defiled by worldly filth

16
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:37,543
I will scrub away every last trace of human emotion

17
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,650
Then it will be empty, a blank slate

18
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:48,675
And ready to receive a supreme Gnosis, brimming with pure divinity

19
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:54,200
Hehehe... Ahahahaha!

20
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:59,623
There is no need to fear. The pain will be brief...

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,151
Your era... is coming to an end
