Autumn had no faith she stuck to when she was alive, and presumably no last messages the day she died.
She once danced like a puppet amidst sweet lies.
When she woke up, the most precious thing in her life, her daughter, had been taken.
Autumn wanted nothing more than a perfect world for her daughter to live in and dedicated everything to make it so.

If you understand the pain a mother can feel, you who are reading this note,
And if you are willing to grant a mother's wish to protect her daughter,
<color=#00E1FFFF>Please go to the shelter in the center of the lake and take what she has left for you.</color> Your kindness deserves her trust.
