Editor's Note: Know that both the "Fischl Dictionary" and the "Fischl Dictionary: Die Neuauflage der Prinzessin" have as their proper name "Heilige Edikte der Verurteilung." As such, incorrect nomenclature during formal occasions (such as literary award ceremonies, should the text be so fortunate as to win a prize) would be ill-suited, ill-considered, and quite frankly, ill-advised.
