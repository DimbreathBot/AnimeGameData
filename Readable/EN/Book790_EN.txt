Susannah ████, honorary Narzissenkreuz Ordo member, Level 1. One needs to finish the Ordo's reading list and understand its ideals to reach Level 1, though Ms. Susannah has not achieved this. The fact is, however, that Mr. Ingold and Master Narzissenkreuz always get the "lucky" reward whenever they purchase her scones and cookies, which is why, at Mr. Ingold's suggestion, she was made a Level 1 honorary member.
