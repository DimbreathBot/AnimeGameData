1
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,300
I always believed we would see each other again

2
00:01:17,825 --> 00:01:20,500
That our days of separation would finally end

3
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,579
And all my troubles would be behind me...

4
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:49,375
If only things could stay this way forever...

5
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,450
...A nightmare?

6
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:12,150
Curious... If you're relaxed, shouldn't your dreams be pleasant?

7
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,995
It was a good dream. It's just...

8
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,979
You weren't ready to wake up

9
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:43,570
Eloquent as one may be, words of comfort are not one's strong suit

10
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,900
You are doing all you can

11
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:52,356
One can see your strength of will, your fearlessness in the face of danger

12
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:56,196
And so, whatever your dream may be

13
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:59,652
One believes that... you shall achieve it

14
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:05,156
Of course, whenever the perils you face overwhelm you

15
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,600
Or you become weary, one is always here for you

16
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,764
After all... As an elder, it is only right to look out for the young ones
