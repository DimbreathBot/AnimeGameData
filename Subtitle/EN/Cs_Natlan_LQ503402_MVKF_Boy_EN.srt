1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,700
Our fight will end

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,500
When the flame is extinguished

3
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:09,075
Fine

4
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:10,875
You ready?

5
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:55,650
Do you never feel tired, or hopeless?

6
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:56,900
No

7
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,287
In war, there is no time for that

8
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:46,775
The fire's out

9
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,050
Let's stop here
