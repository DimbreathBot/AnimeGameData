I'd originally planned to tear them a new one, but the boss says that we should keep a low profile for now. I guess I'll start with that dumb bird at the door then.
A knife through that bird's head should send them the message loud and clear, right?
Since the other directors were taken away, I'll go to the boss after the job's done to tell him what I've done. He'll be so happy, he might even give me a promotion.
Let's go! Intrepid Valberry, away!
