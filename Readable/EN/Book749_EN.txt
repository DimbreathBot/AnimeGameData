...Aftering personally conducting a series of on-site interviews, I have uncovered the full story of the first explosion at the Fontaine Research Institute, as well as all of the facts surrounding the second explosion. It all stemmed from the Institute's attempts to conceal an immense threat so large as to threaten the safety of the entire Court of Fontaine, namely, that the ruins of the Central Laboratory remain unsafe and have not been rendered harmless, and that the location contains hazards such as out-of-control meka constructions, vast amounts of out-of-control Arkhium, and an instrument that could release high-energy pulses at any moment, among other highly hazardous elements.
Furthermore, when the Institute employed personnel to deal with the problem, operational errors caused the Laboratory ruins to explode a second time, resulting in the accidental death of at least one researcher.
It is understood this researcher is named Nacker, and was previously a senior researcher in Edwin Eastinghouse's Arkhium research group. He had been deliberately sidelined by the Institute after the first explosion...

"I picked this up off the ground when I was having coffee in the city, as if someone had deliberately dropped it there... Does anyone know if all this is true?"

"The content within is categorically false, written with extreme bias and vague details to mislead readers. The Institute has submitted this to the Maison Gardiennage for investigation. You may work in peace."
