The Golden Hunter knows far more about Remuria than I expected.

According to historical records, the Marechaussee Hunters should have first become active a few decades after the fall of Remuria, by which point the concept of Lochknights had completely died out in Fontaine. No matter the dramatic adaptation, none would put the Marechaussee Hunters, Remuria, and Lochknights together — For these concepts simply do not belong to the same era. Even a five-year-old child would not commit such a grave error...

Yet none of what he discussed seemed to have anything to do with the Golden Troupe, but instead was — indeed, always was — about ancient Remuria...

I have a theory that I dare not raise with him directly. Perhaps the Golden Hunter is not the "Devout orphan called and chosen by Egeria," but is in fact one of the last Remurian remnants. The only problem with this theory is that it cannot explain his immortality...

I indirectly broached the issues of the Lochknights with him. I couldn't discern his expression, but he seemed reluctant to discuss the topic. Quite surprising. After all, it is commonly said the first Marechaussee Hunters to follow him were the heirs of the Lochknights, such as Este and Walter. Could it be that they were like him...?

No matter what, according to him, the priority now is to stop (...) awakening from the seals. As for these historical questions, they can be left for a later date...
