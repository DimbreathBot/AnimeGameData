Legend has it that in the depths of the mountains of Chenyu Vale, where the water lotuses and jade lilies thrive, when the rain falls and fog gathers in the dawn and dusk hours, looming shadows of the past will sometimes emerge.
According to the village elders, those who dwelled in Mt. Lingmeng once worshipped many supernatural beings, walking alongside the spirit elders of fairies, birds, and beasts within the wild mountain. But in that earth-shaking chaotic war a thousand years before, those gods, fairies, and former inhabitants alike disappeared. Even so, the sentimental mountains retained the echoing memories in the Ley Lines, and thus they sometimes repeatedly reappear at dawn or at night, when fog and rain blanket the land.
Sometimes, herb gatherers and jade artisans will lose their way in this fog and encounter these solitary shadows. As the village elders tell it, an encounter with the ancient fallen is often an ill-starred omen, a sign of unexpected disaster. The Ley Lines, having accumulated and accumulated until growing into tumors, bring forth these ancient regrets and miseries into the present world, and that is why there is fog and rain unceasing. And that is also why the mountain people avoid both like the plague, to avoid becoming entangled in spirit by those ancient sorrows.
Even so, after Rex Lapis completed his great deed of pacifying the land and sea, surveyors from Liyue Harbor would blunder into the fog and rain, disturbing those dreams of old... But that is another tale.
