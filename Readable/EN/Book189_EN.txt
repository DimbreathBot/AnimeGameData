"Wake up—"
Dietrich felt his body being rocked gently.
"Are you alright?"
A hand reached over as if to check his breathing.
It was a familiar voice...
Gentle as the April breeze, and genial as the March sun.

Dietrich forced his eyes open, and before them—
Was the golden-haired, blue-eyed girl.
"Ah, wonderful, you're finally awake," she said with a smile.

"This place... Is this... Celestia?" Dietrich wondered.
"No, I'm afraid it's just an ordinary forest," the girl replied.
Then Dietrich's senses returned to him, and he knew then that the young lady before him was the source of all his troubles — the wicked old witch, Nottfriga! In a flash, he had recovered, and leaping a distance away from her he maintained a guarded stance.

"Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. Ah, I must've forgotten to introduce myself. My name is Magdalene. I'm, well, Nottfriga's younger sister." So saying, Magdalene gave the finger behind her back a twirl — a calming spell of light magic, and she approached Dietrich. "Come now, it's alright."

At this did Dietrich indeed calm down. He desired to ask the girl before him how she could understand him — but he could still do naught but bark.
"Oh, this? It is but a small spell. My sister knows it too."
"Woof, woof woof!?" So that crone did hear what I said, and simply pretended not to so she might string me along!?
"Well... Still, Nottfriga is actually a gentle person." And speaking of her sister, Magdalene smiled gorgeously once more.
