As of writing this note, I have already been laid low by serious illness. Alas, Wayob above, this too is my punishment.
To accumulate wealth, I took advantage of all the information I had access to as a courier and cheated many people.
In the end, after the incident happened, I lost my job as a courier, and all the Mora I swindled became restitution, and I even became gravely ill... Ah me, all I can say is that this punishment is agony... But even so, I still have things I can't get off my mind...
And that is the Yumkasaur who never left my side, my companion.
Alas, I do not have long to live.
I stole this chest. It is regrettable, but I had no choice... All I could do was have it guard this empty chest.
I hoped that, should the chest grab the attention of kind passersby, they might feed my companion something... help it live on. That's enough.
I know you must feel cheated right now. You might even be furious.
You can insult me however you like, because I really am a despicable bastard, a rat skulking in the shadows of the sewers, scum that isn't fit for the tribe, BUT! Do not tear up this note, and do not move the chest, I beg of you!
By the way, if you're willing, you can leave something in the chest so that the next person to open it won't feel cheated. Both I and my Saurian will be most grateful to you...
