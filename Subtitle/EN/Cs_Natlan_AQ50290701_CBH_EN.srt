1
00:00:00,951 --> 00:00:03,912
Your new heart has limitless potential

2
00:00:04,425 --> 00:00:07,803
And you have wielded it with bravery and honor

3
00:00:09,185 --> 00:00:13,272
I grant you the title of "Sentinel Knight"

4
00:00:14,123 --> 00:00:15,910
Like the four pillars of strength

5
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:20,850
You will continue to safeguard the glory of Khaenri'ah

6
00:00:21,886 --> 00:00:24,300
The glory of Khaenri'ah...

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,840
Our land, our dignity

8
00:00:28,577 --> 00:00:32,081
And every comrade who fights alongside us

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,293
The Night Kingdom is almost destroyed

10
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,950
Our fallen soldiers, your comrades...

11
00:00:40,576 --> 00:00:42,275
They have nowhere to go

12
00:00:45,827 --> 00:00:46,915
What are you doing!?

13
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,100
Are you taking all their souls with you!?

14
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:55,332
You're just an ordinary person

15
00:00:55,332 --> 00:00:57,620
You can't bear that kind of burden!

16
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:01,617
No hero should have to wander alone

17
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,412
The curse of immortality...

18
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:15,500
Using immortality to fight death...

19
00:01:16,225 --> 00:01:19,150
Using my rules against me...

20
00:01:19,908 --> 00:01:21,200
Make your choice

21
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,449
Reject your rules

22
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:27,025
Or allow me to trigger the paradox

23
00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:32,575
The curse of immortality must stand

24
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:37,524
Use it to fulfill your final wish

25
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:52,031
Well fought, my lord

26
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:55,171
Thank you for everything

27
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:02,980
This time, let's go together

28
00:02:07,012 --> 00:02:07,908
Yes

29
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:10,071
Let's go together
