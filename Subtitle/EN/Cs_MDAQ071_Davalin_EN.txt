1
00:00:02,325 --> 00:00:04,325
This place is gonna collapse!

2
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,525
It's been a while since we flew like this together

3
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:33,098
Huh, Dvalin?

4
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,000
Just now... Why...

5
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:41,775
Why did you not ask me to protect you like the last time?

6
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:44,166
Me not wanting you to listen to the Abyss Order

7
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:47,175
Doesn't mean that you have to listen to me

8
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:50,675
Freedom, if demanded of you by an archon

9
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:52,751
Is really no freedom at all

10
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,525
Is this... the power of the Anemo Archon?

11
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,750
But I am no longer part of the Four Winds

12
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,800
Even if that's so

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,950
You still protected us regardless

14
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:15,150
Now, spread your wings of freedom

15
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,825
And go with my blessing

16
00:01:25,443 --> 00:01:28,375
And so, the Stormterror threat was quelled

17
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:32,750
I clarified the misunderstanding to the citizens of Mondstadt

18
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:34,950
And let them know that they are safe

19
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,850
To them it seems

20
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,750
Stormterror attacked Mondstadt out of nowhere

21
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,100
And then vanished just as quickly

22
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,675
They must be finding the whole ordeal very confusing

23
00:01:44,675 --> 00:01:47,849
However, winds change their course

24
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,475
Someday

25
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:52,210
They will blow towards a brighter future
